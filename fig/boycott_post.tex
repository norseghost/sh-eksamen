        I never boycott products, but I am now.. \@gillette went 
        in the trash this morning right after I saw their new add.  
        I am proud of being a man and will nor should ever be 
        ashamed of that.  We are half of the entire world Gillette 
        and your entire customer base.

        Never using their products again.  Who can recommend a 
        good alternative razor?

        I'll join others in pledging a \$100 purchase to any razor 
        company that puts out a counter ad.  I'll also post their 
        product on here.
