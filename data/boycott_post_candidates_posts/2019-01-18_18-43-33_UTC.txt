I never boycott products, but I am now.. @gillette went in the trash this morning right after I saw their new add. 
I am proud of being a man and will nor should ever be ashamed of that.  We are half of the entire world Gillette and your entire customer base.

Never using their products again.  Who can recommend a good alternative razor?

I'll join others in pledging a $100 purchase to any razor company that puts out a counter ad.  I'll also post their product on here.
