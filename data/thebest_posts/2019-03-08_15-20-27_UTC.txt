Happy International Women's Day! .
💃Imagine a world where men felt supported by powerful women, not threatened by them.
💪🏻Where being outwitted, outrun, outearned by a woman was regarded as testiment to their ability, rather than a doubt over yours.
🏆Where 'man up' has no meaning because to 'woman up' is of equal merit.
👫Guys, let's stand side by side with the women who had the tenderness to bring us into this world and the strength to fight for a fairer one.
👩‍👩‍👧‍👧 Our mothers, grandmother's, sisters, neices, daughters, wives, girlfriends and friends deserve better, and so do we- Imagine what we could all gain from a world where we're not holding back 50% of the population.
