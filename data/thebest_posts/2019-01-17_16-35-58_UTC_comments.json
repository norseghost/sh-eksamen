This advert suggests that these good men are in the minority, when I believe its the other way round. The bad ones are the minority. The majority of boys and men are good people who believe bullying is wrong full stop. I am fed up with boys and men being accused of being toxic. That they are bad just because they are male. Is that really the message we want our boys to hear? That the future is female, that girls can do without them? Because if you listen closely that is the message being sent loud and clear by the media, films, politicians. The suicide rate in young men is high. They underperform at school. They have increasingly no male role model to show them how to be good, caring, strong, responsible men. That is why the Gillette advert is bad. X",
