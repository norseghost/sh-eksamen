Meet Team WIL!⠀
Say Hi to Joseph our volunteer coordinator and community mobilizer.⠀
⠀
Joseph's work highlight of the month has been: A debate session for Teen Voices in Kaswabuli school.⠀
Girls had to debate in groups whether certain objects / jobs / adjectives could be classified as male or female.⠀
⠀
Though at the beginning words like 'bold' and 'strong' were classified as exclusively male, by the end of the session almost everything had been relegated to the 'can be for both gender' zone. It was great to see girls reclaiming words and realising that we don't have to create separations based on gender.⠀
⠀
One student told Joseph at the end of class: 'I realised that anything a man can do, a woman can do.'⠀
⠀
Keep up the good work Joseph!⠀
