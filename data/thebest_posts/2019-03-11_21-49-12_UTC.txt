We are surrounded by inspirational people with stories to share, ideas to grow and changes to make. 
One of the many people who inspired me on #InternationalWomensDay this year was Jordan Stephens (@althenative) of @rizzlekicks. I heard him speak about toxic masculinity at @wowglobal. The importance of detaching masculinity and femininity from sex and gender has been occupying my thoughts ever since. I for one am proud of both my feminine and masculine attributes. The movement to encourage female empowerment suggests our daughters will feel the same, but our sons?

It is time to question what it means to be a man, the idea of manliness and the role of masculinity as we raise and inspire the next generations. 
Toxic masculinity is the negative behaviour we see grow from repressed emotions and conventional masculine ideals. If the discussion on toxic masculinity is new to you, do check out Jordan's 2017 piece for the Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/23/toxic-masculinity-men-privilege-emotions-rizzle-kicks 👨‍👧👬🏾👩‍👦‍👦👫🏼👨‍👦‍👦🧘🏽‍♂️👨‍👩‍👦‍👦👨‍👧‍👦👬🏿 #toxicmasculinity #realmen #masculine #equality #iwd2019 #thebestmencanbe #rizzlekicks #gender #feminism #breakthecycle #mayweraisethem #balanceforbetter #emotions #inspiration #mondaymotivation
