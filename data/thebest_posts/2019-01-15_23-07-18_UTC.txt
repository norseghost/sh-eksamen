@gillette has absolutely made this ad perfect. My statement from the post is this
The fact this ad is getting backlash is the problem. In this article there is a tweet saying basically, way to piss off your main consumer “masculine men” If “our” definition of masculinity is being sexiest and bullying others, then we found the problem.
This ad gave me goosebumps, we can be better and must be better, and i love that the add addressed that some of us are already doing it, and its up to us to hold others accountable. 
I will be reaching out to Gillette to offer my support, in the mean time everybody should share the hell out of the video, play it a little louder for the people in the back. #thebestamancanbe
