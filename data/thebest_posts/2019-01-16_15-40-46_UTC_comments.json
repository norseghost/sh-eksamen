I think we have found ourselves in a place where we no longer approach one another with kindness and it is incredibly unfortunate. I suppose my hope is that as men soften and embrace their feelings/learn to communicate those feelings and women feel less oppressed and also learn to process their feelings in a healthy way and communicate their needs better- I hope that at that point we will approach the ones we love and even strangers with more kindness, patience, tolerance, and understanding.",

        "text": "My take...like most things that turn politically charged there are lots of angles on this.  Gillette has been losing market share for quite a few years.  The beard is in and beard maintenance requires more priducts than just razors.  They are also losing to places like the dollar shave club and Harry's and even Schick is making refills to fit Gillette products.  From a personal perspective I wont use another razor other than Gillette Fusion but that is not the case for most people.  Gillette was pushing to be more socially responsible....big with millennials.  Thus garnering a new era of loyal customers, hopefully that qas not their only reason I think they did a great job with the ad.  The only things i have heard as far a negativity ( in my circle 40 to 50 year old men). Was the toxic masculinity phrase and that was a turn off for some and they tuned out.  I have read most of the articles you mention above.  Again my take from business standpoint Gillette may have hurt themselves in the fact that they seem to have aleniated some men...As far as the Pink Tax goes. That one upon first glance seems a little hypocritical.  But again is no so simple from just a numbers approach.  Gillette was solely a male shaving company for a long time.  It is not the case anymore.  However although it is still number 1 in mens it is not when it comes to females.  Gillette is now spending a ton of money on research into female shaving and the fact that it is a much arger area and more complex than men.  Gillette initially would repackage their \"male\" line and sell as female razors.  That is not the case any longer.  For instance the Embrace which is a 5 blade razor...like the Fusion i use is the same in only the 5 blades.  The Embrace howver has a ribbon of moisture, a rounded cartridge, a different more  complicated pivot point, a softer handle with grip points that ergonomically fit what their research showed as to how women shave.  Thus comparing price points is not necessarily apples to apples when you compare just blade number.  As far as the other products go...just a guess but I would say more thought and research has gone into those un recent history thus the higher price",
