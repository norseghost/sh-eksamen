Feminism is for everyone, including boys. ⁣⁣

Many people tell me that feminism is anti men. The thing is, I have only heard this from people who are anti feminism. Please understand, feminism is not anti men. All genders face challenges and injustices, and through feminism we can tackle these together. All genders are supported here. All genders have the right to be free of an oppressive culture that doesn’t allow them to flourish. ⁣⁣

Together. All of us. Accepted, empowered, encouraged, supported. Black, white, Muslim, Christian, man, woman, trans, Democrats, Republicans, poor, rich, etc... 👏🏿All 👏🏾 of 👏🏽 us👏🏼⁣
