Gillette have certainly caused a stir haven’t they?

A few days ago, the company released an advert asking men to be ‘The best a man can be’, dropping their usual slogan ‘The best a man can get’. The advert itself shows men intervening when other men are behaving inappropriately towards each other, towards women, when they excuse the behaviour of boys as ‘just being boys’, when they cyberbully or mansplain something. In short, they’re trying to challenge toxic masculinity in the wake of the #metoo and #timesup movement.

Surely it can’t be a bad thing when a large company like @gillette decides to try to tackle an issue like this? Well a lot of people have been rubbed up the wrong way! Social media was rife with comments like ‘I’m going to boycott Gillette now’ and ‘How dare they tar all men with the same brush’. What do you think? Is their advert appropriate or do you think they should have left the matter alone?
