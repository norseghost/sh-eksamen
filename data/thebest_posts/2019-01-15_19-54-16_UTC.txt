Wow, A LOT of men out there are pissed about this @gillette ad! Iâ€™m SO here for it! This message is sorely needed as men like R. Kelly continue to garner support from both men and women...smh. Brands are realizing that they can be an instrument of change in our society. Kudos. Watch the film @maskyoulivein and start a different conversation. #toxicmasculinity #thebestamancanbe #genderstereotypes #metoo #stopthecycle
