The best a man can be....
.
Well I'll be very happy if these boys turn out to be half the man I am, and even more proud of them if they continue with the outlook on life we are showing them..not every one is the same if we were the world would be a very boring place, everyone has there differences and it defines who they are no matter what your background, colour, race, religion or sexuality....
.
These four boys will know what's right and what's wrong and hopefully live in a better society that we live in now, and a safer one..they will know that woman have the same rights as a man and tbh if they don't it will feel like we have failed them as parents, as they are the future and by god I hope they have it better ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™...
