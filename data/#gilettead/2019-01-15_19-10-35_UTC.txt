🗣️Some interesting (and by interesting I mean hideous) comments on the #gillette ad on YouTube. 🤔 What is super interesting about this is that a whole bunch of the #YouTube and #Facebook comments are around how men who "feel" offended by the ad will never buy their product again. 🤷 But who would want them as a customer?! As much as this is a brand trying to align their positioning with target consumers, it's a brand trying to forge a new type of customer. It's a brave step change and it will be interesting to see if other, rather old fashioned brands, will follow suit. 👍If the end result is that they have fewer misogynistic customers then surely that's a win-win. surely.... #thebestamancanget #advertising #ads
