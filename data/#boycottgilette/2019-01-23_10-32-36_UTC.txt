**NEW LOOSE LIPS PODCAST EP** üíã

This week on #looselipspod .....we're recording from Lu's home cinema room...(everyone's got one right?!), because of my hectic @celebsgodating schedule! Lu is hungover, I‚Äôve been on a date night and yet, we‚Äôre back, answering more of your emails and chatting more rubbish. 
This week, it's #boycottgilette that's caught our eye, the new razor ad that's shaking up view of masculinity, plus Prince Phillip's been in a car crash! And to round things off, a flappy rant about #10yearchallenge. 
AVAILABLE NOW @itunes @acastuk 
Please do get in touch with us with your comments, rants....and gis a 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è review of you‚Äôd be so kind (we unashamedly beg)
