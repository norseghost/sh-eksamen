At a point it felt more like a motivational video not an ad. But looking at it from another angle it could be a strategy where they try to appeal to people's (men) psychology by talking about common societal issues and how they can be solved, ultimately making people have a soft spot for the brand \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

Like the brands aren't run by human beings!! If it were a celebrity speaking up, it'll be applause everywhere. I honestly feel like more brands should embrace this and make sure that they use their platform to affect change not just to sell their market.!",
