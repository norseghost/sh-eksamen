Most females that work with us have a family and children thus they can not put in the hours men can because of taking care of their families, some women that are single and have no obligations make as much and sometimes even more than the men.

I said that more men than women have the personality traits that fit e.g. a Manager career and more women than men have the personality traits that fit e.g. nursing. That is not the same thing. Okay, women face difficulties breaking into some high level positions, i agree on that. What about men? They do not face the same difficulties? Don't they have to compete against others too? Don't they have to compete against others, mostly men, that made the pursuit of a high level career their main goal in live and are willing to work 70 hours or more a week for a high monthly income? Women and Men have to compete similarly to get to the top. And men, who compete will do everything to get an advantage, they are also more likely to use unfair ways and do things that will make others dislike them, they are usually not very agreeable. Women usually are agreeable, thats the biggest additional difficulty they face competing for a high end career. Encourage women to be disagreeable in the workplace when needed and they will more easily get to the top. But there is no one preventing women to get to the top because they are women - and if: go to court.",

For you to say that men belonging in high level jobs and women belonging in their own jobs being based in biology is simply incorrect, 78% of female business owners in this study (https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/women-entrepreneurs-pay-gap-freshbooks-survey-28-percent-less-than-men.html) said they\u2019re happier working as a business owner than as an employee. women enjoy high level positions but many find it difficult to break into these fields because they\u2019re not taken as seriously as men, therefore, it comes back to more than just biology restricting women in the workforce.",

Mariana, you said that the social tendency towards men having high level positions and women bearing the brunt on homemaking and child rearing is based in sexism. And I think that is wrong. You as a women do not get punished for pursuing a high level career and not having babies. It is your own decision to do what other people expect you to do. Though in Scandinavia, where the law is the most egalitarian law in the world, the differences in occupation between men and women became the biggest, which indicates that womens and mens interests are biologically based and that the Gender-roles at the workplace are NOT socially constructed. Your Argument is invalid. Also, women taking less shifts then men is not a sexist assumption, it is a statistic fact. According to the United States Department of Labor the number of women working parttime is close to twice as high as the number of men working parttime.

If someone says something you dislike... move on... it doesn\u2019t make you a victim... you my dear... are not a victim... It\u2019s scary to see you are so fragile you can\u2019t handle public interactions and feel entitled to demand society control others behaviors toward you in public yet believe you and others like you are equipped to run a company... or a country... the women who become ceos are not broken because a guy says they have a nice ass in public... lol this is your big struggle in life??? This further makes my point about intersectionality and your complete disconnect of what minority women from neighborhoods like where I was born actually go through....

You seem incredibly defensive of your privilege... And again... completely ignorant on what multi variable studies are... something I learned in great detail working in a hospital environment and can use to look at other studies... educate yourself. It was literally my job to analyze these things in the hospital... what you are preaching is false... plain and simple... We make different life choices then men... that\u2019s not a bad thing... the determining factor of a good life is not how much money you make... I see my man coming home exhausted everyday to provide for us... I\u2019d make the same amount if I did his job... I don\u2019t want to... I\u2019m lucky he is willing to... that\u2019s the case for most women which is why the deviation in pay exists... that\u2019s not sexism... Are there sexist men out there? Sure... but just as you said they are individuals... and this notion of systemic sexism forcing women in to jobs that pay less is a fallacy and the feminist movement is destroying women\u2019s happiness...",

Encurage women to adopt some of the \"male\" traits and they will earn the same money. Men have to adopt \"female\" traits in Jobs like nursing, child care and they should also be encuraged to do so. You may also try to force the government to higher the wages for nursing, child care, etc, thats perfectly reasonable.

Something most people dont know about the rape thing: in Germany, scientists estimate 20 percent of all the sexual assault accusations as false. 20 percent. There is a list of miscarriages of justice at german Wikipedia. False rape-accusations against men account for half (!) the miscarriages on that list. There is awareness about womens issues, but not about mens issues. Rape is bad, no doubt. But the accusation of rape is bad too and it happens often. But everytime someone is accused of rape, most people just act like everything is already proven and the mean man raped the poor, weak woman. I have never experienced a reaction like \"that bitch falsely accused him of rape and made him spent a lot of time in prison.\" after an accusation was proven to be false.",

Break the wage gap down by occupation, working years, part-time oder fulltime, etc and you will end up with a GPG of 2 Percent (Germany). These 2 Percent are caused by personality traits, carrer decisions sexism and other factors. So in total sexism accounts for less than 1 percent of GPG. Less than one percent. If the new iphone is 1 percent off, thats not really an argument for buying it, is it? Why is the GPG of less than 1 percent of any significance? The GPG of self-employed people is 43 percent in germany - and those people do not have any sexist employer. It's only their personality traits and their business decisions that account for the GPG. If you really want to help women to get higher paid jobs and further their career, encourage them to adopt the personality traits they need for that. Teach them to be competitive, to be disagreeable and to put effort into their work. You need to adopt some of the personality traits of men, in order to compete them, just like men have to adopt womens personality traits like compassion and sensitiveness to compete with women in jobs like nursing.",

This is the narrative this video is calling out... 99 percent of men know not to rape and are disgusted by it... 70 percent of child related deaths are from women we don\u2019t see campaigns about toxic femininity and telling women to stop being murderers. \nAs a woman with a son and a wonderful man in my life and seeing these men demonized.",

It all boils down to society! Man has been reduced to nothing or no one. My reasons for we all humans! Society expects a man to give a lady his jacket when they are both outside in the cold!

A lady reports a rape case and he\u2019s arrested instantly, a man does and no one cares! Men are ranked fourth in this modern day society after animals! Statistics don\u2019t lie! You will see more men sleeping on the streets than women! We don\u2019t get preferential treatment like ladies do! The world population shows women are more than men, yet we are the ones seen on the roadside suffering with no roof over our heads! Your lady reports you falsely, you are kicked out of your own house till case is resolved! The society is built in a way that adores women, let\u2019s be realistic! Naturally superior because when it comes to the strength testing part, men are pushed forward! If you r married and u see a lion or any dangerous thing in your surrounding, u expect your man to protect you! It\u2019s a natural thing to do. And all I said was \u201call lives matter\u201d! Mariana, take a time out and be in a man\u2019s shoes! The society expects so much from a man! At a crime scene with a man and a woman, the man is always the first suspect!

Modern feminist want to dominate men. Its just a bunch of man haters.  In fact women need to but out of the affairs of raising men since you are not MEN. Men that grow up with out a mans influence are mote likely to be a bad member of society. Men don't teach boys to go out and rape. Men don't celebrate when men do it. In fact most prisoners will beat the shit out of rapist. Also if you want to dress like a little whore expect to get treated like one. End of story, because women will judge based on what you wear too. You just want to twist shit to fit you own fucked view of the world. Men are not the problem, people like you are. The shit you claim about men just proves you know nothing about what the majority of is like",
