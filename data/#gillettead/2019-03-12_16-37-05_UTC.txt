@gillette sent me their #SKINGUARD Razor. I was raised in a house with two men, so my first razor was a Gillete brand for sure. Can't lie saying that I wax my legs everyweek, but I'm always sure to use a number one brand when it comes to shaving.
It's their first razor specifically designed for sensitive skin and razor bumps. The razor shaves hair and protects the skin thanks to its unique SkinGuard positioned between the blades. It works to minimize tug and pull and cut hair at skin level, helping to prevent irritation.
