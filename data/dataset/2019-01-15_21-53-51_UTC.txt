Have you seen the new ad by @gillette?! We're ROFL at the "outrage" by all the men who can't deal with their toxic masculinity. .

**Taps on mic** "Have you ever watched commercials targeted towards women?!?" They're all about looking better, smelling better, fitting in better so that men/everyone else will like us. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ One commercial towards men and they're rampaging, crying, and swearing never to use this product again! #WoeIsMe #ToxicMasculinity #TheMCSquad .
