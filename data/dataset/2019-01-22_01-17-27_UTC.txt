So this week there has been a lot of debate on the #gillettead and I wanted to hear from the organization what the intent was before reacting. You can read my full interview with them (link in bio 👆) .

My take now on this is even if you dislike the approach, I think the intention is best summed up in this quote from the interview “I want to challenge people just to take a minute and have that ‘moment in the mirror’. For guys, this might even be when you’re shaving in the morning, ask yourself, ‘Are my actions what I want them to be? When people are watching me, what am I saying? Am I doing the things that really reflect me at my best?’ If guys reflect on that, we think that will have a more positive impact on society,” Damon Jones VP, Brands and Advocacy. 👆

This for me is an extremely powerful call to action, and something that all men can do - irrespective of wether they like the ad. Thoughts!?👇
