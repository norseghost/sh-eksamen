They've been listening since the womb, and watching since birth. Raise our kiddos to lead, to be present, and to value respect of others as well as themselves. Showing our boys the way, will in turn protect our girls. Bronx Doula Services prides itself in our efforts to build not just resilient parents, and children but communities as well. We got you covered from pregnancy and Childbirth doula care and support, to sex ed for children, teens and adults. Send the Bronx doula a dm or shoot an email to learn how you can host her class. I am your doula.
