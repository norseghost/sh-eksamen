After a long hiatus, tomorrow I'll be posting a video all about the #gillette ad controversy. It's gonna be a no holds barred slobberknocker JR. *Spoilers* If youâ€™re getting upset about an ad telling you to man up, lead by example, stand up against things like sexual assault and donâ€™t let men get away with that shit...Iâ€™m a little worried about you and you should probably avoid the video ðŸ‘Œ

Time for some #drama
