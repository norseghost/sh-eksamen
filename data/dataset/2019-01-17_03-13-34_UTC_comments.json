As much as I agree that society shouldn\u2019t pressure men to be masculine, they shouldn\u2019t bash men to not be masculine either. Some people think masculinity is toxic or fragile or bad, but it\u2019s not. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being a feminine guy, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being a masculine guy, there\u2019s nothing wrong with going to the gym with your friends or wanting to put on makeup.

There\u2019s no romanticization of mom\u2019s teaching their daughters how to shave their legs, arms, armpits, stomachs, or vaginas. An ad like that would cater to one audience only. Gillette tried to create an ad that inspired men to watch out for those around them and speak out against bullying, harassment, and sexism. That seems like a wonderful message to me. Only when we encourage those with power to address problems will we truly be able to stop it. I don\u2019t think this advertisement was sexist at all, nor that it \u201cdemonized all men.\u201d It simply introduced the idea that when harassment is noticed, it should be addressed, and that men should not be allowed to sit out of helping someone because \u201cboys will boys.\u201d",

The ad isn\u2019t telling men to be feminine or less masculine. Because masculinity in itself is not bad.  But when a strong percentage of men consistently harass or belittle women  the ad is saying hey step up and stop it.  It\u2019s not saying ur the one who is doing these things. So if you got offended by the ad maybe you need to re-evaluate your treatment of women on the daily .",
