// Yeah. Men should learn from Gillette how NOT to objectify women. Right. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ™„ (For the record, I have no problem with any company hiring hot models to sell their stuff. They have every right. But you canâ€™t use sex to sell your product, and then point the finger and tell men not to objectify women. ðŸ˜‚) #HypocrisyAtItsFinest #BoycottGillette
