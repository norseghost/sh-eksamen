Feel out of place? Right, because it is. Most men dont do anything like this, just like most women dont beat their kids, but a company that we dont give a shit about came out with an ad that told us that it is our fault that other men harass, or in my example.

But you dont want to do any of the work or see the truth about the social world of men. Toxic masc doesnt just affect women and us \u201cman hating feminists\u201d it affects men too - but youre so stuck on your single track bullshit of dragging down women who expect better from people you say dumb shit like this. Youre disappointing - but ill still fight for your right to go out at night & not be raped or murdered, and for the rights of the men in your life to not be bullied & mocked for showing HEALTHY emotion or rejecting socially unhealthy masc norms. Ill do that for you while you waste your time feeling like you owe men excuses for shitty, dangerous and insidious behaviour & getting upset because a fucking advert called men out on their bullshit",

        "text": "@the_acctual_fucking_fbi don't be stupid and cherry pick history. One can easily say everything wrong is the world is a direct result of men, such as rape, murder, toxic child like mentality, etc. This commercial basically says men who aren't pieces of shit should speak out against sexist morons who treat women like sex objects and baby makers/caregivers and who excuse toxic behaviors that only stymie society. If you aren't guilty of these behaviors, then you shouldn't be offended but proud. If you are guilty, then your outrage should be at yourself and not Gillette.",
