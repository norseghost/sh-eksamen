I am absolutely appalled with this advert! How dare we emasculate our men with these key messages;
*lets not ogle women *lets stop mainsplaining *get involved if you see any bullying
*speak up against prejudice *your children are watching so be a good role model
.
Iâ€™m going to boycott Gillette immediately for daring to make men accountable and show examples of positive behaviour!
