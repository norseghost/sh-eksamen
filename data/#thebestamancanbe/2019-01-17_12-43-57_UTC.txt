Seriously. If you're offended by the new Gillette ad, you're exactly who it's aimed at.

Women are judged and portrayed unfairly and stereotypically in advertising all the time and it's nothing new. All the advert is pointing out is that it's ok for men to be sensitive and it's not ok to dismiss misogynistic or bad behaviour by saying 'boys will be boys'. Boys, like girls, should have the freedom to be who they are and shouldn't be stigmatised because of it. But above all, we should all be decent human beings.
