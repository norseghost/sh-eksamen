Today, in addition to preparing some awesome awareness posters for Black History Month, we talked about the new controversial Gillette commercial. This ad is aimed at inspiring men and boys not to conform to the norms that society tells them to, in support of the #metoo movement. We all came to the agreement that this is a positive thing in the step towards equality for all! #boyswillbeboys #nottoday #morelikepeoplewillbepeople #compassion #buildeachotherup #inspirational #thebestamancanbe
@gillette thank you for taking a stand to better our generation coming up!
