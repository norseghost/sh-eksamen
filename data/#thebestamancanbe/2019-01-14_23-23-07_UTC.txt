I just watched the @gillette ad that tackles toxic masculinity head on and it resonated deeply with me. As I’ve shared my life raising boys I’ve come into greater awareness of how necessary it is for us men, especially us fathers, to carry the torch of equity and emotional health and because if this it’s become a sort of calling in a way; to use this platform as an example to onlookers of what it looks like for a regular man to do his best to raise boys that are conscious, compassionate, emotionally healthy, believe women, treat all people as their equal and know the power and strength of gentleness, a kind heart and a carrier of big emotions. This new ad from #gillette beautifully depicts the cause in action. And I realized through my watering eyes that modeling this sort of man, one who dismantles toxic masculinity and defends victims, is the most powerful way to carry the mantle. Watching men behave rightly and compassionately, full of emotion and tenderness is the greatest way to believe that you also have that capacity, no matter your upbringing, no matter what your own father was like, if you even had one. I’m so grateful brands like Gillette are using their voice in this way. My boys are grateful.
