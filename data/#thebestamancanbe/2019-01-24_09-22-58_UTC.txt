This makes me so sad. But it's such an important message. Consent matters. And what a woman, ðŸ˜ª child, or even a man is wearing does NOT imply consent. What you're wearing is NEVER an invitation to sex or otherwise. 
We need to stop blaming victims and start changing misogynistic behaviour to avoid nonconsensual acts from happening in the first place. 
We shouldn't have to be walking on eggshells afraid to go out in the world and live our lives. We SHOULD be teaching our children (and some adults!) that consent is not negotiable and that assault is completely unacceptable. No means NO. A dress (or any other type of clothing) does NOT mean yes. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ›‘ #stoptheviolence #stopblamingthevictim #blamerapistsnotvictims #victimshaming #nomeansno #noesno #noesabusoesviolaciÃ³n #mydressdoesntmeanyes #consentmatters #endrape #rapeculture #rapecultureisreal #genderequality #lgbtq #allbodiesaregoodbodies #alllivesmatter #assault #rape #WhyIDidntReport #thebestamancanget #thebestamancanbe #treatothershowyouwanttobetreated #respect #shewillsurvive
