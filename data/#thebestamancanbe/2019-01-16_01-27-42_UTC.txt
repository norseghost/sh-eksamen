@gillette, thank you for your leadership in this conversation. The time is now for men to reckon with how we are showing up in our personal and professional lives. No more excuses for why we behave the way we do, we are holding each other accountable. Resistance will come in the form of men who feel offended by this ad, or women who might feel the message is coming from the wrong messenger, but that is the very reason this #ad is important. Letâ€™s keep the conversation going. @gillette x @thelivesofmen #WalkWithUs
