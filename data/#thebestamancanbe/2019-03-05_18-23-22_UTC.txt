“A father is a son’s first hero.”
.
If that doesn’t give you an indication of how mushy this caption is gonna be, then, well, don’t say I didn’t try to warn ya’
.
As heroes go this man is mine too.
.
I thought I loved him the day I said “I do”. I thought I couldn’t love him more when I watched him with our daughter. And then our son arrived.
.
I am acutely aware of the importance of raising good men. And while I recognise my part, as his mother, in teaching Connor and shaping him, I can confidently say that the best parts of his character will be shaped by the best parts of his father’s.
.
Not by being taught, but by observing... how his father treats his mother, his wife, his sister, his daughter, his clients, his colleagues, his critics. By how hard he works, by how loyal he is. By how he says “sorry”, straight away, when he’s wrong. And how he always tries to do what’s right. Not for him, for us.
