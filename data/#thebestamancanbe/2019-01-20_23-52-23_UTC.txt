In my bio you can read that l have nothing to sell and that l have nothing to influence you with. This is still the case. That said l do feel te need to tell you that l was very touched listening to a story of a 22 old young woman @jessie_maya_  Jessie, a dutch “youtuber “ was born as a boy and since last year her transition was finished. But still she has every single day that ‘ for her painfull’ task to preform; shaving. And explaning what that means to her, she pointed out what the new commercial of @gillette ment to her.
To be honost , me not beeing a shaved man, l was not aware of Gillette having a new commercial. To be short, l think the way Gillette present themself is fantastic. As a father of two beautiful girls l am preparing them to take care of themselfs in a world where “boys will be boys”. I prepare them to fight back. Instead of beeing an example for the boys that watch me aswell. I am that man you step aside for when made angry. That man that will react primary to protect them who need my protection. Gillette made with this commercial a magnificent eye opener #thebestamancanbe #bravo#gilletteadvert #genderequality#toxicmasculinity#dadlife #ifyouknowyouknow
