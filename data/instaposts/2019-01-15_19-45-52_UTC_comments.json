It's more than the stereotypes that are displayed on a daily basis. @lachie_ando44 do we not when survivors are constantly asked what they were wearing, or if the drunk. Survivors are some times encouraged not to report(especially when in college). Rapists get light sentencing so it doesn't ruin their lives. Being apathetic about the issues that survivors of rape are attacked with is the same as encouragement.",
