“A Modern Day Warrior is defined as a battle ready man who lives by an exemplary code of conduct, who embraces courage, compassion and discipline and who strives for the betterment of himself so he may be a transcendent protector, husband, father and leader.” I stumbled across this quote - from an unknown source - and I just felt the need to share it. As I look on at this nation that continues to tear itself apart, I know it’d be easy for me to blame the snowflakes and the weak men of the world for our current situation. But they don’t get all the blame. Many of the old school, God-Fearing, tack driving, alpha male types, are sitting in silence or arguing from behind the keyboard (in which I’m also guilty). But my hope for 2019 and forward is that our “warriors,” our dads, veterans, men of morals, that they’d stand up against the evil and toxicity that has taken shape in this country in a physical way. And no, I don’t mean we need to overthrow the left, but by just outwardly “keeping the faith” and not being afraid to be politically incorrect.. the little things that show we are defiant to this new way of American thinking, and won’t let it highjack our way of life. It’s not enough to say the de-masculinization of America is bad. We have to do something about it.. keep being honorable men, and keep America great. 💪🏼🇺🇸 #maga #america #american #dad #father #warrior #fighter #patriot #veteran #honor #duty #integrity #loyalty #man #masculine #demasculinization #alpha #alphamale #morals #values #battleready #usa #unitedstates #government #defiant #leader #politicallycorrect #thebestamancanbe
