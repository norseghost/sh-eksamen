As a woman, there is no feeling of relief in the body like that when you 'call in' a male friend on male privilege and entitlement and he listens, believes you, takes on board what you have said, apologises, assures you he will do better in the future, and thanks you for your support.
.
Yes, this is just basic human decency, but how this feels in the body shows how rarely we experience it.
.
The blessing is, those experiences are beginning to happen more frequently, and for that I am deeply grateful.
