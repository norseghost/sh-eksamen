My point is only that these things are never talked about in mainstream and I wish they were talked about equally so we can figure out how to better society as a whole rather than the mainstream looking at issues they say are completely linked to men like rape, bullying, abuse, etc when its mor as black and white as these things being tied to men. Yes men rape more than women. Women over the past 5-6 years have grown to be the majority of perps in abuse cases outside if physical. And bullying perpetrators seem to be increasingly young juvenile girls rather than young juvenile boys. This isnt saying men dont do these things it is saying people do these things things! Dont focus on the toxic behaviour of a gender focus on the toxic behaviour of our species",
