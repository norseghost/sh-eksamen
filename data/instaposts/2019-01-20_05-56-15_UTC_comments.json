        "text": "Thanks.  I too have seen full footage.  My comments were from the hesitancy I saw in some faces.  From some boys who turned away and some who joined in and some who didn't leave their fellow student when a space around him cleared and backed him up.  There was nothing wrong with what I said.  Perhaps you misunderstood.  And guessed what I meant.  It reminded me of a school I once attended.  The Elder walked towards him and got right up in his face.  Too close if it were me.  Fortunately we can both say what we wish and debate.  I wish I saw someone say let's stop.  Let's not do this.  He is an old man.  This may or may not have happened.  We weren't there.",
