What about female malevolence then, who causes that? Is it other females? Is it also just males? is it a combination of both? Malevolence can be a consequence of an infinite amount of things, some not even human related and Im shocked that you've made such a bold statement. I've met men who are the toxic masculine types because they have been mistreated by a woman or women some have even went as far as being misogynists.",

Look Im not saying you're wrong im just saying gillette must be careful because I've come to learn that society has a tendency of over simplifying complicated situations. Like part of the conversation should be females, girls and women alike should also stop making it okay for boys and men to behave the way they do. I always used to ask myself why the biggest assholes in school always had girlfriends. Everybody knew that these guys were up to no good but yet someone was always willing to date them and its kind off strange, its like being a up to no good made them quiet high in demand on the dating market. Society as a whole plays a role in this situation. Its not exclusive to men, this was just an example... But i truly do commend you for what you're doing.  The real change starts with the individual. Gillette on the other hand can carry on selling razors even though men are switching to other brands after this ad campaign \ud83d\ude02",

Let me break down where I stand a lil but more. I believe men will always have a bad side just like women do, actually all people are capable of evil, now you throw something like bad parenting into the mix and you have a bad child who'll grow up to be a bad individual and even worse a bad member of society, you see what i did there i said bad parenting not toxic masculine fathers. My point is this, we cant as society go and highlight the evil that a group of people is capable of and make a whole ad out of it. People say bad things about the islam faith because of a minority of muslims who cause a lot of chaos in the world, for instance isis, and I believe the majority of people can agree that that's not what the islam faith is about. My point being it is wrong that gillitte is shinning masculinity in a bad light because of a group of bad men, the same way it is wrong that people shine the islam faith in a bad light because of groups like isis.",

The centerpiece of this ad isn\u2019t grown men; it\u2019s kids. The ad climaxes with footage of sweet-faced lads and the lesson \u201cThe boys watching today will be the men of tomorrow.\u201d Gillette\u2019s argument is that we need to be careful with the choices we make as adults because children learn decency and morality from us. As Slate\u2019s science-based parenting columnist for the past six years\u2014a job that has given me the opportunity to interview dozens of psychologists, social scientists, and pediatricians about the factors that shape child behavior and character\u2014I agree passionately with this idea. Kids learn by watching what we do, not by listening to what we say, and boys in particular absorb a lot from their fathers as well as from male public figures. They watch prominent men in their lives stick up, or not, for victims of bullying or sexual harassment. They watch how men treat their girlfriends and wives and interact with women in public. Many boys watched one man, the president of the United States, publicly mock a woman who testified to Congress that she was a victim of sexual assault. Many also heard him brag about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy.",

But, as an adult and early childhood educator for twenty years and a male for fifty, your anecdotal tourism aside, The facts aren\u2019t with you. Just days before the release of the ad, the American Psychological Association (APA) issued new \"Guidelines for the Psychological Practice with Boys and Men.\" The new guidelines highlight the unique physical and mental health risks that boys and men face, including higher rates of completed suicide, violence, substance abuse, cardiovascular problems and early mortality. They also issue a warning against conforming to traditional stereotypes of masculinity, citing years of research that links machismo to the aforementioned health risks. Those are facts garnered by clinical studies with empirical evidence to back them up. The report states: \"Socialization for conforming to traditional masculinity ideology has been shown to limit males' psychological development, constrain their behavior, result in gender role strain and gender role conflict (Pleck, 1981, 1995; O'Neil, 2008; O'Neil & Renzulli, 2013), and negatively influence mental health (e.g., O'Neil, 2008, 2013, 2015) and physical health (Courtenay, 2011; Gough & Robertson, 2017). Indeed, boys and men are overrepresented in a variety of psychological and social problems.\" Gillette hit the nail on the head.",
