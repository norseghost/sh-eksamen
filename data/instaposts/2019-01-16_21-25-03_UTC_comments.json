It made me proud knowing I have male friends that would stand up for me like the guys who step in to help the harassed women. It made me feel more confident about speaking out when I'm in an uncomfortable situation and asking for help rather than keeping my eyes down and mouth shut pretending it's not happening. It made me feel for boys who get horrifically bullied at school yet the stigma behind telling someone is too great. Finally it made me have much more respect for those who agree with the moral stance of the advert regardless of the product.\nStanding up for those you see who are being oppressed. Who can argue with that?",
