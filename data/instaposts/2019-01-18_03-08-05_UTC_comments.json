I can understand why people would think the sexy ads are created by men to appeal to men and that supports toxic masculinity, but a lot ads have sexually attractive men, too. For me the issue with a sexy ad is more about beauty standards than it is about the sex appeal. Using sex appeal to advertise to me shouldn't really offend feminists bc a lot of women may be happy to do it.",
