SO 👏🏻 MUCH 👏🏻 YES!
If you haven’t seen this new ad, please do so immediately bc it’s well worth the 01:48 of your time. Kudos to Gillette for using their 30-year old tagline in this new campaign as a platform for important discussion. There’s so much debate around this, but that’s what we need more of! Let’s come together as a culture to redefine what’s best for boys and address behaviors that are toxic and detrimental to mental and physical health. We talk about breaking barriers and stereotypes for race and women, but let’s not forget our men. Let’s redefine all “traditional” roles. This ad is about how all of us can set an example for the next generation.  And hey, if you’re threatened by a commercial asking you to be a better man you don’t need a new razor — you need new standards. #MeToo
