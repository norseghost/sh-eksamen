I saw a comedian a few weeks ago called Daniel Sloss and he is renowned for doing a 10 minute \"serious chat\" somewhere in his show, highlighting an issue that is important to him (he's on netflix, check him out, fucking hilarious) and in his current tour he is talking about a girl friend of his that got raped by a boy friend of his and then he did this incredible speech that was the most poignant way I've ever heard someone speak to a room full of people about this issue, addressing the men and saying it is \"our\" responsibility to fix this, to call people out on bad behaviour and stop this being such a regular occurence... And everyone clapped so loud and it was amazing. Why is it always the few twats that ruin it for the majority. Most men don't think that way, they might not always jump in if they see it but most men want to do right and I believe that! \ud83d\udc9c",

When it comes to issues such as these it's easier to deflect the issues at heart and to get up on a soapbox and hurrrrummphhh about it all than to look deep within your own soul and actions and realise that you may be part of the problem.",
