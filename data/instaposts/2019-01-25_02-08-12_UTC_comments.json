There is no culture for raping anyone. Rapists are fee and far between and are both male and females. Females generally dont get arrested or go to jail for it. I was raped technically, but as a man i know my issues will be laughed at and ignored and i\u2019ll get called a sexist for even mentioning that men have problems too. 4 to 1 suicide rate between men and women :)",

Men and women often expect that who ever they want to have sex with should automatically want to have sex with them back. I dont know about you maybe my school was just bad but we were never taught about the importance of consent at school and in my high school i have overheard some rather disturbing comments made. One in particular stuck in my mind \" your not a man till youve raped a bird mate man up\". Im not gonna lie i only heard something this bad once but its so sick and saddening that a man could say that to another man and try to poison his mind by telling him he should do something so awful. I simply think that 'rape culture' is the lack of educating girls and boys at school the importance of both people giving consent",

Generalizations are dangerous because then people assume the intentions of said group. That stereotype of mra not caring about women can draw people away, just like the stereotype of feminists being irrational can draw people away. All rape is bad. This account focuses on male survivors because it is an under represented issue in society, one that usually leads to being mocked or questioned if it can actually happen. I\u2019m thankful for any group, including feminists that fight for legislation on this issue. Another point to add would be that people listen to feminists and not mra and that\u2019s why they were able to pass the legislation. Feminists care about gender equality and so do we. - Erik",
