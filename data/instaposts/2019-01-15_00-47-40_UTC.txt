Bravo #gillette
Bravo. Addressing toxic masculinity isn't easy. Breaking down barriers and stigma that have been built up for hundreds and hundreds of years isn't easy. We've been socialized and/or colonized into thinking these ways. Men are conditioned to view aggression, stoic - emotion repression, notches on bedposts, size or strength, drug and alcohol tolerance, and a host of other negative ways of thinking... As manly. As masculinity. 'Boys will be boys' is bullshit. People like Brock Turner were told that phrase growing up and use it as a cop out for acts of mindless aggression. We can be better. As men, as a society. We need to promote healthy minds and healthy development. Compassion and emotion are NOT weakness. Femininity is not negative. What's negative is raising 1/2 of human beings to be incapable of processing emotions and feelings in a healthy way. Sure, Gillette is a company selling products to make a profit, yeah. However, Gillette is sending a very positive message through media, and media is a tool for socialization. Counter the narrative. It's past time to end toxic-masculinity. .
