I'm a #proud and #masculine guy. #Share your #beard by #tagyourself I'll upload it here. I stand opposed to the attack on #men in the wake of #metoo. We already deal with high suicide rates and on the job deaths. Most of us know right from wrong so your critique is a non-issue.

#gillette has inspired me to make this account. Come one and come all. Let us bask in our own glory! Being male or masculine isn't inherently a negative thing. #boycottgillette #toxicmasculinity #cishet
