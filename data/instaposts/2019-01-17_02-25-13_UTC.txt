#Gillette is facing a lot of backlash over its new ad called “We believe”.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The ad is meant to confront American culture, showing men and boys bullying each other and engaging in sexual harassment. Narration then encourages them to “say the right thing” and “act the right way”.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It continues over scenes of men changing their actions:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
“We can’t hide from it. It has been going on far too long. We can’t laugh it off. Making the same old excuses. But something finally changed. And there will be no going back. Because we... We believe in the best in men. To say the right thing. To act the right way. Some already are, in ways big and small. But some is not enough. Because the boys watching today will be the men of tomorrow”.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
While some have praised the ad, it has caused an uproar among others. Some have taken to social media to say they are now #boycotting the brand and have posted photos and videos of themselves discarding @Gillette razors in protest.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
In a statement to the press, Gary Coombs, the president of @proctergamble ‘s global grooming business, said: “Gillette believes in the best in men — that by holding each other accountable, eliminating excuses for bad behaviour, and supporting a new generation working toward their personal “best”, we can deliver positive change that will matter for years to come.”
