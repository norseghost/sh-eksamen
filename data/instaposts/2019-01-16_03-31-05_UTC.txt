Ok this new ad for gillette is making everyone go crazy, i have watched it a few times now and i think this is just a realy bad ad and the fact everyone is divide over an ad asking us the be better as a person is evidence of that.

The first half has audio talking about toxic masculinity, bullying, sexual assualt and the me too movement over the top of footage of men being dicks and looking at themselves in the mirror, this tells me that as a man i am a terrible person because i was taught to be this way as shown by the "boys will be boys" part. 
Then the ad flips to saying not all men are bad and there are good men, but the good men need to help the bad men be better and teach our children to be better aswell. 
The last part is the message, but it failed miserably to communicate it. Instead of a tap on the shoulder and saying "hey, there is a very serious issue we need to talk about and this is what we can do to address it" it taps you on the shoulder, hits you in the face with a chair, calls you a bad person and then pats you on the head and says but you're ok, go show others how to do it.

It's incredibly important to talk about issues like this because they are important, but gillette could have gone about this in a better way.

This is just my oppinion and it doesnt mean im right but i would like to hear from anyone else about this, hopefully we can keep it civil.
