        "text": "I've watched the ad after seeing your post about it and I think it's a fantastic ad to put out there in the current climate. It's not oppressing men or telling them to lose their 'masculinity' but about being respectful to everyone, women and men included. To treat everyone well. Not to use the sentence 'boys will be boys' which I actually really Hate!! I am raising a girl and my Husband is amazing with her. She said to him the other day that she couldn't do something as she was 'just a girl' and he told her girls can do anything boys can and we are equal to eachother and that she is never 'just' a girl. I tell her this all the time as since she was born 5 years ago there have been social stereotypes set for her about what a girl can and can't do. I'm constantly correcting them. It is important our girls hear from Fathers too that women are treated as equals and are to expect to be respected. Just as girls should be taught to respect boys. I do find other Mothers can be really bad at promoting equality with their Sons though and I've lost count of the times I've heard 'boys will be boys' when their sons are being aggressive and they don't pull them up on it. My daughter was the only girl playing with a bunch of boys all aged 4-5yrs old and one of the Mothers said 'oh I'm surprised she's playing so well with them, that she can cope with all the boys' as if a girl shouldn't be able to?  But I said that she doesn't care who she plays with as long as they're nice to her. It's about mutual respect. Women don't want to be superior to men, we just want to be equal. Thank you for posting about how your raising your girls. It's inspirational and I hope more parents will be like you too \ud83d\ude0a",
