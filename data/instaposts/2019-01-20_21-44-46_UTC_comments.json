It\u2019s when the farce of \u201cmanhood\u201d overwhelms the good qualities of men and the bad acts you listed come out\u2014 symptoms of men not feeling adequate because of the pressure they put in each other. It\u2019s a lot like how women experience toxic femininity when they berate each other as sluts or fat\u2014 we put the most pressure on each other to be superficially feminine instead of allowing the true feminine nature to surface. I\u2019d love to see men concerned about that, but it\u2019s rare to see a man that isn\u2019t happy to hear a woman call another women a slut (thanks to toxic masculinity that teaches caring about women isn\u2019t manly).

Are you really that daft? No you can't be more wrong. The correct correlation would be Jesus to Mohammad and let's say a Imam of a Mosque to the Pope of the Catholic Church. So tell me how Mohammad is relevant to the Pope? Then explain what Mohammad has to do with a live flesh and blood elected leader currently alive and making decisions for a church and sect of Christianity. Now you could say why does someone slam Christianity and not Islam. That's two religious philosophies. And even then what flawed logic you would be using. Because A) saying what you said is called whataboutism. If that's the rule we live by then no one can ever speak up about anything. Because injustice exists around the world in many forms. So if someone needs to include ALL injustices when they speak out about one because of you whataboutism folks... then no one can ever meet that threshold and no one then should ever speak out against anything. Whataboutism is the logic only intellectually dishonest or inept people use. And reason B) why you your logic is bull shit is this woman wasn't speaking out against Christianity. But see you don't know how to have a real debate or be intellectually honest about it. She was singling out a ELECTED OFFICIAL from a church. For PERSONALLY knowing and being responsible for covering up sex abuse against minors by clergy. I can go on and shred you some more in this conversation...",

Its toxic when women think they should get the door open for them by men and they should pay for dates and a number of societal pressures put on men.  Unfortunately for you that is also a part of toxic masculinity.  Its not men vs women issue . You have a simplistic view on this issue and maybe just maybe if your first instinct when you read about toxic masculinity is to ignore everything the phrase stands for talk about \"bad women\" then you'd understand that nobody said men are bad and women are good and always the victim. Its what you infer because you are in a way deflecting.  Just FYI (because you are too \"simple\" upstairs) - there are just as many bad women as there are bad men. You happy? \ud83d\udc81",

        "text": "@annaleesalvatore you missing the point girl \ud83d\ude02 but I get it, it's much easier to be judgemental and spread hate and misguided thoughts! The truth is, you don't know the truth and you don't have the information needed to make any kind of comments about Islam or the Prophet himself. If you were coming from a well informed place I'd take your words into an account but it's pretty ignorant to be so vocal about something and yet you don't really understand it or know anything about it. Delusion is when you believe you are right and knowledgeable. It's sad, but I really hope you don't continue relying only on mass media! Wish you all the best \ud83d\ude0a",
