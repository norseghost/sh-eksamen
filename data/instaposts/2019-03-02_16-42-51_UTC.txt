Can we please urge men to not sexually assault women? Can we teach everyone the definition of #consent?

Consent is defined in Canada's Criminal Code in s. 273.1(1), as the voluntary agreement to engage in the sexual activity in question. The law focuses on what the person was actually thinking and feeling at the time of the sexual activity.

And yes, we know #notallmen. Also, if this post offends you share your comments with your therapist, not here.
