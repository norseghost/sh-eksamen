Who is the Modern Man? And is such a concept even relevant? If you have seen our post on the latest Gilette Campaign #thebestamancanbe then you will be aware that a debate on masculinity and its relevance is a hot topic. There are many more in-depth looks at this worth checking out like @goodmenproject but we believe this: The world will always need better humans to act as role models for positive change. Men make up 49.2% of the population worldwide. On numbers alone it makes sense that the more #positivemasculinity there is in the world the better place it will be and that should be our collective goal #makingtomorrowbetter #inittogether #dotherightthing #ballsinyourcourt credit @unsplash
