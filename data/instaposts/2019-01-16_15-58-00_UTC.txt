"boys will be boys"
"he's mean to you because he likes you"

unfortunately, these are words i uttered to my friends, my family and worse of all, to my children.

these days i know better.  i am better.  i choose to do better.

it started with my granddaughter. i didn't want her to ever think it was ok for a boy/man to ever put his hands on her.

i never wanted her to feel like she was less than.

i didn't want her to let other people's opinions define her or to allow her to think that she should care about what others had to say about her.

whenever i am with my granddaughter, i ask her to recite her daily affirmations with me.

i am smart
i am strong
i am special
i am kind
i am powerful
i can do anything for i am a child of god (she says with her arms outstretched while pumping them in the air). friends, i encourage you to remind your daughters of how a man should treat her - YOU remind her of that by how you treat her mother.

i encourage you to remind your sons of how a man is to treat a lady. like a queen, with respect and admiration. you remind him that a woman deserves a man who loves his parents, his family and God. most of all, you remind him that he should be able to look in the mirror and know that the way he treats the women in his life is no disappointment to his parents as long as he treats them the way he was taught.

this is what i try my best to impart on my children. i pray that it has resonated with them and they are respected and respectable.
