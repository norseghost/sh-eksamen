I am grateful that my husband who knows how to love and adore a woman. 
As men become enraged about a #Gillette commercial asking men to be respectful, conscious and aware of how manhood is messaged to their sons.  I am so thankful that my daughters are being raised in a home where their father shows them every single day that he loves their mother. ðŸ’– Plus he still runs a bubble bath for me after my long and crazy days. Love him so much!
