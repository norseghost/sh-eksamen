Men feeling that way towards women also have serious consequences but a reminder that it's not all men and often doesn't escalate to such a drastic measure. Jumping to \"feminists made this\" is where I don't get it. The ad isn't saying men acting like men is toxic when there is a boy getting hate messages and a boy getting chased by others. It isn't a feminist who makes that statement negative when it's used in stories where girls are targeted or gay boys are targeted and the excuse adults use is \"boys will be boys.\" Men do have a right to say in this but it's the way men are saying it that others are joining the conversation.",

Toxic masculinity is the concept that men aren\u2019t \u201creal men\u201d if they respect women, believe equal rights, defend homosexuality, or act in any way that might emasculate them (crying, for example). Men who are often deemed to show \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d generally respond to something like \u201csex worker raped by politician\u201d with \u201cwell, she\u2019s a whore! She gets paid for it, that means it can\u2019t be rape\u201d. They also generally reply to the word \u201cfeminism\u201d, or anything to do with it, with a wrath that rivals Satan. All because we just want to be treated with respect. Because we have the audacity to stand up and say \u201cSOME men are shit\u201d. The toxic PEOPLE will come out and shut us down, telling us WE\u2019RE the shit ones and we deserve being TREATED like shit because of our gender, race, sexual orientation etc. But mostly it just translated to fear. And for the record, I don\u2019t believe in \u201cmansplaining\u201d. Just in PEOPLE who refuse to open their mind to other opinions/possibilities. Men are not the only PEOPLE who can be toxic. Women are absolutely capable, and \u201ctoxic femininity\u201d exists too. Except, that\u2019s when women just shit on PEOPLE (yes, other women too) because they\u2019re cunts.

They fought for EQUAL OPPORTUNITY because they weren\u2019t allowed to work, vote, speak, think, have a say over their own bodies/lives. But feminism has evolved since then. It literally means \u201cequal rights between the sexes\u201d (look it up). And since you brought it up, allow me to name just a few things feminism has done for MEN: Ensured men get the vital reproductive health services they need; taken the pressure off men to be the \u201cbreadwinners\u201d of a household; successfully changed the legal definition of \u201crape\u201d to include men as victims instead of just women; made it possible to charge an abusive female partner with assault, stalking, or any other behaviour that endangers men; started the fight against gender roles, which INCLUDES liberating men from harmful stereotypes (like the ones that create toxic masculinity). So fine, I agree, feminism WAS about men. But don\u2019t say it never did anything for them. Equal rights. That\u2019s all.",
