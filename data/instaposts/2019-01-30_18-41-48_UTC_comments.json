But, tell me, can you find coloured men here among the guys who act like assholes?  Why? Because it is politically incorrect. This ad is an attack to white men, who are much more woke than our men are. The message is on point, but the subconscious game being played is not nice. 'Toxic masculinity' is being shoved up their asses. That's why, the ad got a negative response.",
