The latest episode is live. Not only can you listen to it on your favorite podcast platform, it is also available on YouTube (link in my profile). This was the third time in week @andy_grant and I jumped on our microphones and pulpits together to raise awareness of men's mental health. Obviously, he cares about it because he's a man. And I care about it because I'm a mom to a Future Man. So, that should tell you a little something about what you'll hear in our conversation - men's mental health isn't just a "man thing" - it's a human thing. .
