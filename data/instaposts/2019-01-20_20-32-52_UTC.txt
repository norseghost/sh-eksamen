A watershed moment is a turning point, the moment that changes the direction of a situation. Otherwise, a dividing point, from which things will never be the same. .
In the case of mental health, it is the fact that science and research has shown how the brain is actually formed - and that it's not a fixed state. We are able to now look into the brain and watch neural pathways form and reform. And what science knows is that your brain is growing & learning all the time.
