By now we have all watched the controversial #Gillette ad.
‍::
Personally, I loved it. It gives me hope when a big company looks past the many fears around a polarizing issue and actually takes a stand. Gillette did this beautifully.
‍::
Yet, there are many people who disagree with me... They received some strong rejection on social media, particularly Twitter.
‍::
This NPR article sums it up well, this is one of my favorite parts:
‍::
Gilette is so far exuding a quiet confidence.
‍::
"Successful brands today have to be relevant and engage consumers in topics that matter to them," a spokesperson tells NPR. "This is especially true when it comes to younger consumers — a key demographic forus."
‍::
Call it a new kind of corporate machismo, volunteering to march bravely ahead into the culture wars.
‍::
No longer can companies "just advertis[e] product benefits," the Gillette spokesperson says in the email. These days "brand-building" also means taking a stand on important societal issues, controversial as they may be.
