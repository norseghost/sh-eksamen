I’m not one for political rants or even sharing my opinion regarding “societal issues,” for a few reasons but namely b/c of the backlash & polarity associated with such conversations & having a difference in opinion. The fact I had to pull this shot from @gq for a proper snapshot of this new ad is a shame in itself. Nothing against @gq, but it was the only place I could find a neutral perspective about the commercial that’s making headlines today. The negative outcry from men on this ad is truly disappointing & further reflects our disconnect with each other.  @terrycrews words “men need to keep men accountable” is a notion that has helped me develop to become the man I am today. 10 years ago I committed to a #mensministry that introduced me to my brothers from @lwachinoca. These men have all contributed to my development & inspire me to live as a #manofgod. I’m far from where I desire to be, but I know that with my brothers around me, the confidence of my wife @celestlarue, & the unfailing grace & love of #thelord I’m growing closer every day to the man that God’s called me to be. @gillette - thank you for challenging the status quo, thank you for encouraging men to require more of themselves, & thank you for being a brand bold enough to stand on principles greater than selling a commodity. Nice work fellas!! 👏✊
