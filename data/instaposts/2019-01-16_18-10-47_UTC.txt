This is my husband & my Dad. My husband of 21 years has truly been a partner & a great role model to our teenage daughter. Through him she has learned how a “real” man conducts himself. I learned the same from my Dad. I find it interesting that the new Gilette commercial has some people upset. It shows men modelling the behaviours that I am fortunate to witness in my husband & Dad. Thank you @gillette for showing “real” men behaviour. Please share the pics of the “real” men in your life! #thebestmencanbe
