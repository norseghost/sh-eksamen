They showed toxic behaviours and at the same time the good ones (stand up forb a girl, stop a fight, teaching daughters to be strong), so your point is a huge nonsense. \"My cats\" won't love me, because I don't have any. I'm married actually. Seriously, you are incapable of telling the difference between \"toxic Masculinity\"(Catcalling, mansplaning, bullying) and true, awesome Masculinity (for  example, all those good behaviours which I mentioned earlier). And if you think, Catcalling is something respectfull, then, as a woman, I'm so happy I'm nowhere near you.",

The ugly ones are the ones who made it into a problem because they weren't getting the attention. Mansplaining is a made up thing by 4th wave feminists looking for something to complain about. Feminists are ruining the world for women by creating seperation leaving more and more women to not find their guy so they end up lonely, depressed, and feeding their cats. Everything good in your life was made possible at the hands of men but go ahead and keep following the seperatist agenda. Your cats will love you more for it.",

If it\u2019s not real fighting, girls do this too. That\u2019s just another stereotypical scene which was unnecessary.\n\nThe advert also made reference to how some men are already acting the way they should. So, rather than saying only some men are good, (Implying the majority are bad), they should say the opposite, only some men are bad (and acknowledge most are decent human beings) that is what has got people\u2019s backs up the most.\n\nThen they stereotyped men as being big dumb oafs stood behind barbecues, that\u2019s not okay either.\n\nA lot of feminists seem to think if we don\u2019t like the advert then we are all for this bad behaviour, when actually we don\u2019t like poor antics either but we dislike the way men have been portrayed and masculinity as a whole.

Noone said that they are bad people, just that they can do better. I study automatics and robotics, it's considered as a \"manly\" field, and those behaviours are way to common. When I say \"stop doing that, stop whistle, stop being patriarchal\" the answer is \"What's wrong with it?\".
