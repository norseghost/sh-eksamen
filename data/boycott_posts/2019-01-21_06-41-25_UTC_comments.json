We were working behind computers, lending books, selling books etc. My boss told me I'm too weak for carrying books (fun fact, he's never seen me before) and told me I can't do that. Then he told me, that because I do less work, I'll be paid less. So I had to work overtime to achieve the same wage as my coworkers. By that time, I needed money for something, I don't remember what it was, so I didn't really wanna leave that job. But I also had much less time to study, I was overwhelmed and I couldn't do anything about it. Eventually, that was that time when I started talking with one of my (by now) best friends. She's always been very feminist. She was the only one who told me: ,,Rosa, this is not ok. Leave the job.\" Of course, unequal pay is not possible in the eyes of law, but it doesn't mean it doesn't happen to average women. It happens often. It happend to my mother, to my friends, even to my dentist. You gotta stop closing your eyes and comfort youtself with \"but it's illegal\".",
