Only allowing yourself to view perspectives that fit with your own will never allow your mind to grow. I implore to attempt looking at this commercial (and make other key problems with our country today) with a clean mind instead of a set opinion. I made a previous comment on this post addressing this issue, I ask that you read it and give it a chance. I\u2019m aware that you\u2019re free to do what you wish (I couldn\u2019t care less regardless of what you decide to do) but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to get a different angle of this subject. Good day.",

Lol. It\u2019s not often you can have a good debate without people acting out of line.\n\nI agree with you on the overall message. I feel a lot of work needs to be done with both genders, I sometimes get overly upset as I\u2019ve lost a few close Male friends to suicide so sometimes I get carried away trying to advocate for men\u2019s rights and I forget to stop and remind myself that I am a woman and I don\u2019t know what every man wants or how every man feels. I need to keep myself grounded a bit better in that respect. I\u2019ve seen some men suffer due to women being given unfair advantages in certain areas and it makes me feel bad as I don\u2019t always feel the allowances and shortcuts for women are justified, but that is another conversation entirely.\n\nMy overall view is that men should be whatever they want to be, whether that is masculine, feminine or a bit of both. And the same for women of course. As long as a person is a good person then they should embrace who they are and not feel ashamed for that.\n\nAnyway I\u2019ll end it there, I wish you a good evening.",

Seems pretty rare on Instagram unfortunately! Critique of an ad is a good thing if it moves the conversation forward, in my opinion.  I noticed the men behind the grills too, but honestly didn\u2019t think about it that way.  You\u2019re right that it\u2019s an over the top stereotype - I don\u2019t think they meant to criticize men for grilling (at least I hope not- that would be pretty silly) but yeah it does come across that way.  As for the boys playing I\u2019m not a parent so i can\u2019t really weigh in on that - I don\u2019t really know how kids relate to one anther these days, it\u2019s probably different than it was when i was growing up in the 90s. Personally I appreciated the overall message of ad and Im glad that it\u2019s getting people talking about these issues, and everyone\u2019s experience/reaction to it is and should be different. but I realize it\u2019s not like, a perfect piece of advertising.  Lots of advertising aimed at women is subtly critical of women\u2019s bodies and appearances, and companies try to sell us stuff to \u201cfix\u201d what\u2019s wrong with us.  Thsts changing now, sort of, but beauty and fashion are still billion dollar industries that profit on women wanting to change the way they look.  So I guess I find it kind of odd that a lot of people are upset about this one ad that is critical of men\u2019s behavior. Anyway, you gave me some things to think about so thank you :)",

I certainly do not fit that description and have many gay friend both Male and female.\nI actually feel there is a good message underneath it all but strongly believe that it has been put across in a terrible way.\nThe main issue I have is when it said that some men behave well but many don\u2019t (sorry I do not remember the exact wording) this gives the impression that the majority of men are at fault rather than the minority. It could have been worded far better.\nI also feel the whole line up at barbecues was terrible stereotyping, it\u2019s no better than a row of blonde women in bright pink clothing trying to decide which heels to buy. The father telling them off for rough housing was OTT, many girls and boys play like that and as long as they\u2019re not actually fighting then it shouldn\u2019t be made bad or attributed just to males. That\u2019s the kind of thing which has angered me, not the message behind it. Or the guys watching women on tv as if it\u2019s a bad thing, or as if women don\u2019t enjoy looking at other women on tv.\nLike I say it\u2019s not at all what you\u2019ve implied there but more the sexist and stereotypical way it was done.",

But in comparison, it's one in a hundred times. The bullying case is true however, I will give you that one. In school scenarios, girl students statistically are more prone to be bullys. However that's not the case with the other issues. The ad is also not saying that masculinity IS those things. It's saying that there is a form of masculinity that encourages those things. In this day and age, thankfully there are significantly less men like that, however they still do exist in large numbers and cause genuine issues. The point of the ad is to hold men accountable to stand up to others when they that kind of stuff happening. If you already do that, then I reiterate. This ad was not aimed at you. No need to get upset.",

Understand why men are not agreeing with the notion we are all rapists, we are not abusive when 75% of domestic abuse of all categories is perpetrated by women.

The ad is stating (utilizing their own previous commercials) that this toxic way of thinking needs to stop now and it starts with us. That being a man isn\u2019t fighting or being overly proud, it\u2019s standing up for others. It\u2019s ending a fight. It\u2019s respecting the people around them. All men definitely are not bad, most are the kind of people that Gillette argues are the best a man can be. But the film shows that there are STILL toxic people in the community and THEY need to be held accountable. The men showed in the commercial aren\u2019t meant to be a representation of the gender as a whole, but rather a piece that has to be addressed.
