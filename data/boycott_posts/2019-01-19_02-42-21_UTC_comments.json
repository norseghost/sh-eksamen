I think if that was supposed to be catcalling it was a bad example because he didn\u2019t really say anything other than just walking after her. I think with your toxic femininity example we probably see more eye to eye than I thought.  I do agree it could have been done better too. No hard feelings, just trying to explain my side of the argument.",

I'm not saying it couldn't be done better, I just know why they didn't do it more \"polite\". This is controversial, so it gone viral within a day. It's great marketing move. It caused thousands of conversation, and society needs it. Personally, I'm waiting for Venus (Gillette \"sister\") response (of course it could be just one big campaign) about \"toxic femininity\" and that would be awesome.",

Because although some of the examples given (such as rape) could be considered toxic masculinity, their two main examples of toxic masculinity were two children wrestling and a guy wanting to ask a girl out because he found her attractive. If they had made it differently (focused on just the sexual assault ) and not said that most men were the problem and instead said that most men were NOT the problem, it would have been a great ad and I would have no problem with it. So when did you get lost in the ad?",
