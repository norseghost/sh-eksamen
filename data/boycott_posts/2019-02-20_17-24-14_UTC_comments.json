For example, a number of my friends (guys) cannot tell their fathers that they love them because it is ingrained in them that showing affection is feminine. Also alot of the times toxic masculinity has been cited by females is because it entails women being forced into stereotypes. For example, toxic masculinity is men not knowing how to cook or clean because it's a woman's job.",
