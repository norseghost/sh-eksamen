I think it's a good sign for society. The ad made me ugly cry. But then again I also know that the ad was meant to draw an emotion out of me. So I feel like it was pandering quite a bit to feminists like myself? I wonder how many women buy razors for their partners, and if Gillette is trying to gain favor among those decision-making women. All press about the ad is good press for the brand.",

I have been really disappointed with men lately because I have been trying to get back into dating but guys seem even worse than before my last relationship. Guys are almost encouraged to be jerks and act like you're the crazy one if you want to be respected. Or prudish if you want to be monogamous. Im Going back to single 5ever and then maybe in 20 years things will be better thanks to this Gillette ad and I can have an old man bf in my golden years",

But by standing by and doing nothing, even those of us who would never engage in sexist or catty acts ourselves somehow imply that such hurtful acts are at least tolerable, if not acceptable.  I doubt that this Gillette ad will help the company's bottom line, but if it encourages more good guys to speak out against behaviors they personally don't engage in, then all of us will benefit.  Now I'm waiting for an ad from a woman's company encouraging women to speak out against malicious gossip and \"mean girl\" bullying!",
