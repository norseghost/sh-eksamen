And when true only if the boys are circa 11 and upwards which they very clearly were not. If you go to YouTube and watch the advert on 0.25 speed you'll see the boys very gently touch hands. Well adjusted boys are loving at that age and sometimes show love in a bromance way through these kind of actions. They new the BBQing alpha males would be in favour of this kind of rough and tumble which is why they had THEM end it as then it's a real brain screw because it's like we're making you the hero to stop behaviour you would otherwise agree with. This amongst many other things is why the advert has very many subliminal messages that are very unkind to men. Look at Kim Gehrig other video on YouTube it actually made me feel ill and you'll an insight into why she has issues with a certain type of man. And why those men now have issues with her x",

Both genders ( only 2 because im speaking genetically) have what everyone calls, \"toxic\" traits. Its natural.

The kid in the commercial on the bottom of the \u201crough and tumble\u201d was not smiling when the man pulled that other kid off him. Maybe the commercial wasn\u2019t talking to your  kid, but there are definitely kids out there who need to hear the message, from this commercial, from people who have seen the commercial, and from people who have never seen or heard of this commercial. The ad is not perfect, it\u2019s clunky, but I do not care, I support the message that there is a lot of male behavior in the world that needs to be checked, and it\u2019s men\u2019s responsibility to check ourselves and each other.",

Gillette\u2019s view suggests that there is something that makes men more powerful or intelligent, such that the onus lies on men to make society more inclusive. Do you realise what message this sends? Society should be gender-neutral, but funnily enough it\u2019s become more embroiled in gender stereotypes. \nLastly, this whole \u2018guilt by association\u2019 campaign does little to bridge any perceived gender/ masculinity gap. When you label all members of a certain demographic as violent or vulgar, you are likely to incite more hate and increase such behaviour rather than reduce it. The future generations of that demographic have already been labelled and branded, so why not engage in more violence, crudeness, and \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d? You are all mistaken if you think this is about being offended.",

        "text": "@cream_doughnut @frankensteinsuperstar @mr.masonhenry \n@bagel.bitchhh @cream_doughnut First off, can we address the claims about \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d around here? \u201cToxic masculinity\u201d was a concept invented by 20th-century upper-class gentlemen and used by feminists to undermine authority. This concept \u2018created\u2019 a phenomenon to challenge stereotypes, by using stereotypes. From your comments what I have gleaned is that \n1) If men don\u2019t publicly denounce this concept they are toxic, sexist beings\n2) If I disagree with their message there must be something wrong with me (or those that think like me) \n3) \u201cToxic masculinity\u201d is something that only men can \u2018produce\u2019 \nAt best, this merely plays on gender stereotypes that only  men are aggressive and vulgar. Something which would be sexist, if you were not occupied in the double standard that men are inherently aggressive. Your comments have shown that you are perfectly willing to engage in reverse sexism, because you perceive that men are the aggressors. \nThe ad, and this post, seems to blame men and masculinity for bullying and torment, which is moral relativism at its finest. Did you know that almost two-thirds of women bullied in the workplace were also bullied by women? That\u2019s from a survey taken by Cecilia Harvey from the  Development and Learning in Organisations journal. That\u2019s not taking into account school bullying, where authorities don\u2019t have an exact figure of which gender bullies others more. \nAnd before you say that the bullying by men is more hurtful, that\u2019s impossible to quantify, considering that victims may feel less or more hurt depending on circumstances. Bear in mind that boys can also be involved in \u2018girl-type\u2019 bullying and that girls can also use violence & extortion against other kids.",
