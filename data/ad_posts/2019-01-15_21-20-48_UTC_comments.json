I'm a gay man, and apparently that makes me a \"beta male whose balls got cut out by feminist\" <- THIS IS EXACTLY what the ad is talking about. Go into youtube comments and you'll see it. What the ad is pointing towards IS RIGHT FUCKING HERE, it's not some made up gimmick. Women too sustain some aweful behaviours, but this is talking aboit toxic MASCULINITY, which does NOT BY NO MEANS mean that girls are holy pieces of bread. It just means that it would be great if we talked about the shit MEN do, and then try to improve ourselves by leaving them behind.",
