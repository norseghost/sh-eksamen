It went from the best a men can get to a best a man can be, just to create tension and sell. Any advertisement is good advertisement, but they saved millions by having us talk about it instead of ads. Also think about it, most men who shave and groom aren't wife beaters and such, so to who does this message address to? Plus it's not like a wife beater will suddenly see this ad and go hmm you know what time to change my habits \ud83d\ude02",
