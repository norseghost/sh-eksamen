Reading about Gillette’s new ad, “We Believe,” has been super interesting. Who knew razors were the next frontier for controversy in America’s discussion of gender inequality?
🤔 Women. Women have been arguing about gender inequality regarding razors and other toiletries for awhile now. But that’s besides the point. A major male focused brand has entered the discussion so now it’s a BIG DEAL.

In all seriousness, these articles from Forbes, Vox, and GQ are all pretty interesting with their various perspectives. As are more articles from Wall Street Journal, Times, and NBC. NY Times and Boston Globe probably also had interesting points to make, but I don’t subscribe so I couldn’t read them. I haven’t built up the courage to read the hyper-red side of the argument yet.

Bottom line is: I would be really interested to know what my peers think. On the one hand, I really liked the commercial. I found it touching to see something that is discussed in my groups be exposed and supported on a grand scale, with men taking on the responsibility for changing the behavior of other men in our world. On the other hand, many are arguing “well Gillette still has a pink tax on razors; they only did this as a marketing ploy; as a multi-billion dollar company, one ad doesn’t do much to dismantle the immense power structures that keep our country at status quo.” Some of that I agree with... some of it I don’t. The Forbes article is particularly interesting because the author looks at the issue purely from a Marketing Tactic perspective. His reference to “ #LikeaGirl “ missed the mark for me. But what do you think? Go watch the commercial and let me know!
