If that\u2019s the case then I would be willing back off a bit...even though I would say that I have never been witness to boys maliciously beating the crap out of each other and a family friendly function and men nonchalantly or approvingly standing by.  That would get shut down immediately and men should be given more credit than that. My understanding is that they were playing. Even so, the problem isn\u2019t the excessiveness of male upbringing and the fostering of aggression. If anything the problem is closer to the massive ABSENCE of men in the home to train (not squelch...train) the inherit aggression in their sons, AND DAUGHTERS for that sake. Because it\u2019s not like females (whom Gillette also provide products for) are innocent and don\u2019t participate in bullying, oppressive behavior. Just sayin.",

        "text": "@dennero I totally hear you man. When engaging in disagreement or conflict there should be a verbal discourse to deescalate the situation. You will never hear me disagree with that. But that\u2019s not what the AD is suggesting. The faulty assumption that is being made by Gillette is that there is a direct causation between boyhood back yard wrestling matches and the violence you see on the street and schools, the harassment you see in the workplace, and the objectification of women in media. I would disagree with that assumption. Further, The solution they painted was that if a father would stop their sons from wrestling then we are all better for it. That is assuming there is no utility to wrestling. I believe there is. I think you want these boys to meet their limits physically, emotionally, and intellectually in the safety of their own home under the observation of people who love them. To help them know that they are aggressive and flawed creatures and need to PRACTICE honing that aggression into something productive. By doing this, they will have the courage AND the ability to stand up for the bullied, to call out the inappropriate behavior in the workplace, and defend their community from objectification (including doing so against themself if need be). To assume they could, and would, do this (let alone do this effectively) by avoiding boyhood/manhood is just unwise.",
