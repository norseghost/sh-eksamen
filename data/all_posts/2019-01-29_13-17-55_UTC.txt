An open letter to @Gillette : I applaud you for your new "best a man can be" campaign. The commercial with the daddy holding his daughter in front of a mirror having her repeat positive affirmations makes me feel love and hope for our children. The father breaking up two kids fighting when other parents shrug, "Boys will be boys," make me respect and admire this character.

I agree we can do better: For our kids, our peers, and for ourselves! Look at this man's shel. I'm not sure why he buys 3 deodorants at a time, but he buys them. And they're your brand. I've slowly introduced products without aluminum, "fragrance," parabens,  and other potential carcinogenic and otherwise harmful ingredients to his shelf.  The best thing is he loves the way they perform and I love the way his skin feels. 
__  I can't help to reach out to you about #Gillette deodorant containing aluminum, PEGS,  and fragrance. I don't need to educate you on they these are harmful because I already know- I've committed myself to research what goes in my body. I made a switch to safer ingredients myself.

But the men we love- they deserve the best, too! Can you make a safer and effective deodorant for him and for  all of them? And make it affordable, so they don't need to even think about it? When I'm in a bind, sometimes I use it, too. I'm continually on a search for safer deodorants but he's happy buying what's on the shelf at the store. This is where you can help our guys be the best they can be. Please make a deodorant without carcinogens, links to Alzheimers, and artificial fragrances. Or disclose what's in the fragrance. Men are more aware of what they're using and we want what's best for the guys we love. The purchasing power is there, we just need the product.
