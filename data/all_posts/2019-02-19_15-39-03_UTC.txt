I think it’s finally time I let this go. As most of you know I’m one of the admins of this account, John. I’d like to share my true experience of double standards.. I’m 16 and I go to a high school in Nevada. I was going home one day and there’s a bus driver and she’s been the driver for about 2 years, as long as I’ve been in highschool. One day she randomly decided to sit on my lap in front of everybody, it honestly was super embarrassing. I told her numerous times to get off of me and she still wouldn’t, when she finally did she said “stop complaining you know you liked that.” It felt horrible.. the bus was full and everyone was laughing.. even my own friends.. I was so angry and embarrassed I decided to leave, as I was walking off she physically blocked me from leaving and said “I made love to you you’re not allowed to leave” I eventually made my way through her and left. It took me almost a week to even get one of my school administrators to even listen to me.. when they finally did an investigation of this I had a choice to press charges, the only thing she could be criminally charged with was false imprisonment due to her not letting me leave the bus. Although she couldn’t be charged with any of the other disgusting things she did 😔 if this were a girl and a male bus driver the story would be so much different.. even months later I still get comments from the other students making insulting remarks to me because of the incident. I hate it. It’s unfair how the situation was handled. If you have any questions please comment them below and I’ll answer them the best to my ability.  #mensrights #mensissues #maleactivist #malepositivity #malebodypositivity #bodypositivity #mgtow #equality #sexism #misandry #masculinity #genderroles #gay #conservative #gayconservative #mensrightsmovement #mra #himtoo #meninist #politics #man #men #boy #feminist #equalrights #malevictims #boyappreciation #gillette #boycottgillette
