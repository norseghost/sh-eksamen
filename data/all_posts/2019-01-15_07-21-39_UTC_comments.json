All these thing you listed are going to happen if this world continues to pretend that these things are the fault of men. No one in the world now is responsible for what slavery did to black hundreds of years ago. No man is responsible now for what men did to women generations ago. Just because someone is born as a male or born as a white doesn\u2019t make them automatically racist or sexist. And guess what? I\u2019m pretty sure the liberal hell will come thanks to all this toxic liberalism. I hope you are happy when there are open borders, high taxes and infinity genders.",

Secondly, if women needed to fix a social behavior, and a company called them out, no i would not be offended. Women are guilty of toxic femininity as well, but the ad wasnt for women, it was for men. Finally, it didnt say all men are like that. Im convinced you didnt actually watch the ad, because you just strawmanned thrice. As for the other issues, divorce, rape allegations, paternity frauds and child custody, most of that does need to be fixed. Youre absolutely right. None of that is acceptable social behavior and should be targeted as well. But again, the ad isnt for that. Its for a group of men who exhibid toxic and shoddy behavior towards women and eachother.",

They pretty much suggest anything that is basic masculinity, as toxic masculinity. Then they compose this AD to specify toxic masculinity, when its already been pushed that basic masculinity is toxic. No one supports people being Gropers or Bullies. Just like no one supports rape, yet the SJW PC Police world suggest that we have a rape culture. Bottom line is, its all just propaganda to further divide people. You see the AD in one way and other people see the AD another way. Those of us who see the propaganda, just see the narrative that they are trying to suggest its a normal thing for people to do that. If they want accuracy in the AD, they should really show Muslim men doing those acts. It\u2019s unfortunate, but those who believe in Sharia Law would do exactly what this AD is projecting on only White men. (Im not white btw, just an observation)",

If they want to do a video of anti bullying and anti sexual harassment, they should stop using labels.

And it\u2019s terrifying and dangerous to society that people even think this ad is good. Men are a group of people and if an ad is telling that us men do no good for being who we are then of course there will be men who feel outraged just as if there is an video making women look bad.
