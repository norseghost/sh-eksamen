The media and society always paints the same image: a man assaulting a woman, and she being the victim. There have been too many times that when a woman rapes a man, news articles state that she “forced him to have sex with her”, instead of using the word rape. Also when men sleep with a minor they get life sentences while a woman gets 120 days, according to an actual story on the news. I’m sick of the double standards, all I want is equality, true gender equality. We are all human, and all of our actions have equal consequences. - Erik
