I will NEVER buy your product again @gillette . You've pampered the wrong group this time. We need more masculinity not less. More fights not less. We, the men of today, are pushing for a brighter future where men arent treated like second class or animals, and boys are allowed to be boys. A future where we dont put every young boy on medication becuase hes acting like a boy. Or force them to be apologetic for the achievements we've made as men. #boycottgillette
