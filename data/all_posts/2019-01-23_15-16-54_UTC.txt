What makes these attributes masculine?
How is being â€œjustâ€œ, â€œhonestâ€œ and â€œbraveâ€œ directly tied to being a man or â€œmanlyâ€œ? Arenâ€™t these universal virtues anyone should aim at?

Calling me as a woman masculine when I am intelligent and honest is saying Iâ€˜m more of a man, so in conclusion: less of a woman in my expression, because women are not inherently brave, right? Or strong? Or protective? Itâ€™s robbing women of these attributes. 
Understand this: When I say â€œI want to get rid of the concept of masculinityâ€œ Iâ€˜m not saying I want to a) get rid of men b) shame men who are what we stereotypically consider â€œmasculineâ€œ c) get rid of those traits in and of itself d) erase the attractiveness of these features. I want people to stop making forced associations that enforce gender roles and stereotypes. Women can be fierce, strong and compassionate. Men can be sensitive, empathetic and smart. Stop gender-labeling universal human experiences. ðŸ›‘
