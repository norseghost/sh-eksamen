This is a topic that really bothers me and lots of women are misinformed on this subject, men do typically make more money than women and that’s usually because, statistically speaking men work more hours, men take less sick days, men work more dangerous jobs, and it’s also proven that men retire at later ages, it’s also not factored in that statistically speaking men work more overtime hours which pays more than regular working hours. Some women do point out that they’re paid less then a man for working the same job, and that’s just nonsense, the way it’s observed is simply looking at the yearly income between the genders without factoring in any variables. Taking all of this into consideration it’s no wonder why men typically make more money. I would also like to add, if companies and different corporations could get away with paying women less, wouldn’t they only hire women so they could save money and expand profit? Admin - John
