#TheBestAManCanBe commercial by #GILLETTE #spotlights the question, "Is this the best a man can get?" The ad focuses on #challenging #men and boys to #StepUp. Do more when they see #bullying, #sexualharassment or just plain #harassment of others.  To #DoTheRightThing in those moments when many might turn the other way or go along with the #crowd or #MobMentality.  To change #ToxicMasculinity in all #Patriarchial societies. To be #positive #male #RoleModels to the #boys of today who will be the men of tomorrow. To say, 'Yes, I am a #feminists and believe in #feminism, which basically means the belief of #equality of the sexes  The piece is a step in the right direction.
You know all the toxic males and #misogynist out there?  Well, they do not like the ad.  And boy are they letting everyone know. 
Oh well.  Changing to being #equal to all when you feel you are on the top of the food chain or better than others must be a hard transition for toxic males. 
There are far more men stating that they feel the ad is a positive step in the right direction by stating they are not part of the toxic male movement, which is on its way out of society.  Good to know many more #evolved men are stepping up and out to support this ad and it's message. 
Probably why over 4.5 million have viewed the ad and only 352,000 have disliked it.  Because #ToxicMales are outnumbered and soon to become #dinosaurs in our time. ~ Phoenix Rising ©2019 #MISTRESS2MUZIC #PHOENIXRISINGZ #TWITTER @phoenix_risings https://www.Facebook.com/PHOENIXRISINGZ
