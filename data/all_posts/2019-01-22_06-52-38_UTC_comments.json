Real men are strong to protect, not to attack the weak. Real men step up and say no to this kind of behavior. It takes a lot more courage to go against the violent. To be a bully is easy, to fight the bully you need a real man. So yeah, man up everybody \ud83d\ude1c",

I do hope this inspires good men to stand up to their friends who exhibit this shitty behavior. Only complaint about this photo is the expression \"man up,\" which I feel has been used to shame men and boys who aren't masculine enough. But maybe this is a new definition of the phrase, than man up means be better.",

My Book \"What is Pusillanimous...The basics of masculinity and femininity\" satirically demonstrates 10 toxic masculine traits and provides guidance on how to be a better man! At the same time it allows women to understand how they are allowing and in some cases re-enforcing such behavior! #pusillanimous #polarityexpert #masculinityfeminity",
