Taking the negative behaviour of a small number of people and then holding a much much larger group collectively accountable simply because they share a gender with those people is sexist. It's not about being offended or not. It's about calling it out for what it is. What is wrong with you all? How can you not see this? If an ad came out asking black people to stop each other mugging people would you be saying \"I don't get it - they're just asking black people to be decent human beings!\" Check yourselves.",
