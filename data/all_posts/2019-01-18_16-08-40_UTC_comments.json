I\u2019d felt screwed by the over inflated pricing I\u2019d been forced to pay for basic communication services for years in my twenties. Fast forward to modern times (\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude09) I was increasingly frustrated with why a Gillette blade razor pack was $35-45. Dropped them two years ago and started using Dorco blades. Read they were the blade source for the dollar shave club someplace. I stop going to see music performers live when they tell me who to vote for. You can say go vote, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019d much prefer though you just shut up and play your tunes though. Now a major razor company feels \u201ccompelled\u201d to do something to save humanity - from men?Please. We\u2019re all in favor of anti bullying campaigns. Just be a good human to other humans. An entire focused ad stating men are toxic? Pfft. Alrighty Gillette you win the virtue signaling award for 2019 just two weeks in. Congratulations. \ud83d\ude44",
