Here is my take on the #GilleteAd 
We all know really great men who don't fall under the toxic masculinity category. For those amazing men in our lives, this commercial is not about you and is referring to those who wreak of #toxicmasculinity

If you're wondering if you fall under the category of toxic masculinity, let me give you just a few examples of #toxicmasculinity that I've personally endured.

If you say to your female employees "I hate to see you go, but love to watch you leave."
*
Take a picture of your employees cleavage and then send it to the boss.
*
Think your female co-worker wants a dildo as a gift and wants to fuck you just because they are kind to you.
*
If you don't want assistance from a female service advisor, simply because she's female.
*
Being called a "skirt".
*
If you're offended by a commercial that is calling out shitty "men", think about anyone of those comments being directed at your daughter. What's more offensive?

Ladies, if you're comfortable with it, I encourage you to share your toxic masculinity encounters ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ #bebetter #talkaboutit #metoo #callthemout
