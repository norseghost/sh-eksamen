I can still remember the jingle to this ad from the 80s: *sings* “Gillette, the best a man can get!”
.
This week @gilletteuk launched a new ad to revitalise this slogan. Have you seen it? It tags onto the #metoo movement to call out toxic masculinity - but in doing so have seemingly alienated a large part of their customer base.
.
Are Gillette a brand who got it wrong? What are your thoughts?
