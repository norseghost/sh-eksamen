        "text": "@ej._1703 Well, similar to what I told @watervogel, what you're describing isn't linked to masculinity. Violence and sexual assault are already regarded in a negative light by the vast majority of people. There is no gendered social component that compels such behaviors. Most men don't call their friends or family members names for liking feminine things. The fact that men are less likely to express their emotions in feminine ways isn't due to socialization but rather due to the biological differences between males and females. We have different hormonal balances, neurochemistry and so forth. Psychological distinctions are inevitable. Again, men don't generally insult their friends for crying. In fact, if a man cries, other men usually take that pretty seriously given that men are less likely to cry. Real friends try to cheer each other up, not order them to stop showing their pain. I hope that helps clarify things a bit better.",

        "text": "@watervogel No one in their right mind is teaching boys not to talk about their feelings or be territorial. Stoicism and territorial behaviors are effects of our biology, not learned from others. Discrimination against those considered to be different, while potentially harmful, can also be traced back to our evolutionary biology. These are not socialized, socialization actually tempers those proclivities. That's why it is important for there to be male influences in a child's life. Studies have actually shown that single parent homes, specifically single mothers, produce the vast majority of children who go on to be depressed, commit crimes, commit suicide, etc. Fatherlessness is an issue. Toxic masculinity is a buzzword. Both men and women can display problematic behavior such as those examples you gave, so it isn't gendered or linked specifically to manhood.",

And women don't need men to protect them from wild animals or war, etc. So the need for strength is diminishing.

Everyone has a different perspective. Take time to acknowledge perspectives that differ from yours. Only week minded people agree with \"what's best for society\". There is never one approach or resolution. More importantly, toxic masculinity DOES NOT exist. This is the point you're missing.
