I had ordered this book before I saw the Gillette ad.

Before I saw the rebuttal article that made me cry.

Have you seen it? The one from a Christian organization that I used to follow? That many people I know still follow and deeply respect? The one that said men like my son weren’t going to heaven and it was “unloving {of Christians} not to say so.” (Because the worst thing these men can imagine is having traits remotely tied to femininity.) I was upset. Disheartened. Worried for the future.

Then this book arrived on my doorstop.

Real cowboys “think of others.” “Real cowboys cry.

While that Christian organization is intent on yelling that masculinity is being destroyed, this book is a quiet reminder for my family that masculinity can look very different than the toxic examples we often see today. “Real cowboys can be strong, and tough, and homesick at the same time.” “Real cowboys are as many different colors as the earth.” “Real cowboys are girls, too.” I’m taking some artistic license and adding my own verse today, writing what my heart needs to hear: real cowboys aren’t threatened by other cowboys who insist there’s only one way.

Real cowboys are among us. They are you and they are me and together (whether through birth or fostering or babysitting or teaching or “aunting”) we’re raising the next generation of real cowboys who will carry us into a brighter future. // (Keep an eye on my Stories in the next couple of days and I’ll share more of this beautiful book!)
