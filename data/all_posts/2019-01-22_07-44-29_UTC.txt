Here is a Man telling me that humans are not above animals thus the only way for rape and sexual harassment to stop happening is for the victims to take responsibility and get a gun and shot them. And to instill fear in them. Because jail and murder has really stopped them in the past right ? I will agree with only one point he said. We need masculinity positive masculinity. We don't need rape culture and we don't need sexual harassment being glamorized and humorized in our culture. We do need to stand up and we do need this movement. #positivemasculinity #rapeculture #toxicbehaviour #victimblaming #wecanchange #riseup #nomore #activism #screenshotchallenge #notacompliment #thebestamancanbe #toxicmasculinity
