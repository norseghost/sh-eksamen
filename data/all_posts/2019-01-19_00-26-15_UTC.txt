We are not saying this is a depiction of ALL men. Because it’s not. The majority of men are not bully’s, sexist or have the pack men mentality. 
However sadly there are bullies female & male. Although this is possibly a huge generalization and buying @gillette is not going to make you a nice person lol. 
It still made me cry.
It still touches on a topic so heightened by social media and so relevant to everyone. Because at some stage in your life you could have been nicer. At some stage in your life someone could have been kinder to you. 
We are human. 
When you see someone’s surgery you don’t like, stop and think before you speak ✋ 
If you are against surgery, ✋ stop and think before you speak to the women or man excited about their procedure.
If you think a picture is too sexualised, or the women is too skinny or too fat, ✋ stop and think before you criticize another women. .
