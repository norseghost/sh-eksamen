Basically, women are oppressed by stupid men that don't know a thing about women or their biology. Like how they shouldn't drive or ride bikes because it would fuck up their womb and ovaries. And no education because their brains can't handle it. So just because there are laws giving women rights and freedoms that doesn't mean that there isn't other bullshit out there that oppresses or harms women. Dudes just want to ignore all of that in order to tell women that there is nothing to complain about.",
