Kicking off 2019 way out of my comfort zone, clashing with @thepiersmorgan who thinks the Gillette ad is an attack on masculinity. Because they only give you about three and a half minutes to get your point across, I didn’t have the chance to say what I really feel, that in this world of #metoo, prejudice, gendered harassment and every day sexism we need to reconsider what is accepted behaviour. It’s not ok to tell boys who are punching each other that ‘boys will be boys’ in the same way that we don’t just shrug and say ‘well, rapists will be rapists’. We need to treat people as people, regardless of their gender, race, looks and sexual orientation. This advert doesn’t criticise men, it criticises toxic behaviour,  celebrating a more modern masculinity which I find way more attractive. I’m amazed at the backlash to what is essentially a message about being decent people. Why are the critics so uneasy about this? Being a parent is all about leading by example, modelling the kind of behaviour that you want your children to emulate. Treat your peers with the respect that you would want your children to be treated with and don’t be afraid of criticism. I don’t always act in a way that I’m proud of, sometimes I’ll say something or do something that, on reflection, wasn’t the best decision. But instead of becoming defensive, I’ll reflect and think about how I can change for the better. Every day I ask my children to be the best they can be while I try to be the best I can be. That’s not perfect and I’m ok with that but I have no problem with an advert that thinks about #thebestamancanbe Good on you Gillette.
