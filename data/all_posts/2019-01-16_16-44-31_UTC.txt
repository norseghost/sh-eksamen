Gillette's new #bullying and #metoo focused publicity campaign launched yesterday, faced blacklash for attacking men. Intelligencer's Josh Barro comparing it with Nike's Cole Kaepernick advert, writes "The difference in reaction to the two campaigns helps us see what kind of social changes companies will and won't be successful at pushing. Nike's message to costumers is uplifting rather than accusatory. The Gillette campaign is a downer, asking costumers to reflect on and changing their own behavior."
