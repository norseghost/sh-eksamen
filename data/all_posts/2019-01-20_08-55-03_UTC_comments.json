I'm always willing to open my mind and I honestly take in what you mean as it has given me a bit more of an informative approach and idk why I brought up pro life \ud83d\ude02 you caught me on that one, I'm just here to kind of see an insight to which you kindly told me instead of attacking me like what a lot of the liberal side would do which I appreciate:) but I do think maybe think in general that the fluent activists shouldn't necessarily be men, it's about equality right? Let women speak up FOR the men too  if you kinda get what I mean",

I normally find myself to be the odd one out, as I\u2019m sure you do too at times.\n\nI genuinely don\u2019t think anybody is trying to drive away our support though, I just think men are better placed for running men\u2019s pages and us women can still support without being in control. \nTo put it in context, I\u2019d expect women to be running a women\u2019s group account but would welcome everyone to support it, if that makes sense, I don\u2019t think there is any malice there or anything.\n\nPro life and pro women are separate things to me, I know that\u2019s an entirely different argument but the child is 50% father and 50% mother so it\u2019s not really the same thing in that respect. Although that\u2019s not a topic for here and now, I just feel the comparison isn\u2019t the same.\nAnyway I respect you for standing up for men, keep fighting the good fight \ud83d\udc95",

Why would you only want to limit to make supporters it's quite narrow minded and like shooting yourself in the foot- you want as much support as you can for these things and if a feminist said female only, it's labled as extremist and misandry (although according one feminist I spoke to misandry doesn't exist to that bitch lol)",
