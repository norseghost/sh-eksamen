In thoery having one movement for equality would be great however becuse society is made up of men and women (also other, but for the sake of simplicity I will only mention the two) there exists a need for two sides to represent their group and their opinions/movements and furthermore to foster a intellectual and productive discussion. Simply having one group would lead to in-fighting and disparity in group veiws. This relates to my statement regarding femisim speaking for mens issues. I belive its fair to say that the majority of pepole who identify as a feminist also identify as female and due to this i dont belive that they could (holistically) speak for mens rights/issues. Much like a man cannot effectivly speak to females issues and understand in the depth that a female may be able to. Because he himslef does not experience those issues as he is a male.",

We still need to fight for women\u2019s rights, but as things have gotten better for women, men have also suffered from prejudice. Why I still call myself a feminist and not egalitarian, is because the movement also empowers women. Egalitarianism can not empower everyone because everyone must be equal, but sometimes certain areas need more of something. This why feminism fights for everyone, but it helps people in certain areas. It is not repurposing, it is simply evolving the movement to make it better in modern times",

Also claiming that feminism fights for mens rights is simply dismissive and reducing to the issue. Personally i dont think that femisim does or furthermore should fight for mens rights. Because the movement was created to help women not men. To some degree i find it insulting as repurposing femisim for mens rights or adding it into the same movement implys that mens rights are not as important as female rights as men are added as an \"afterthought\" so to speak.",
