Well the Gillette brand has evolved a lot since this ad ðŸ˜‚

Kudos for their recent campaign on toxic masculinity following the #metoomovement. 
As a mother of a young boy i thought it sent a powerful message on learned behaviour and the next generation of boys. 
Despite the backlash, I predict their sales will soar, they sell pink razors too... ðŸ˜œ
