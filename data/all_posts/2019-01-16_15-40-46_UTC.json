Who knew razors were the next frontier for controversy in America\u2019s discussion of gender inequality?\n\ud83e\udd14 Women. Women have been arguing about gender inequality regarding razors and other toiletries for awhile now. But that\u2019s besides the point. A major male focused brand has entered the discussion so now it\u2019s a BIG DEAL.\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nIn all seriousness, these articles from Forbes, Vox, and GQ are all pretty interesting with their various perspectives. As are more articles from Wall Street Journal, Times, and NBC. NY Times and Boston Globe probably also had interesting points to make, but I don\u2019t subscribe so I couldn\u2019t read them. I haven\u2019t built up the courage to read the hyper-red side of the argument yet.\n\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc\nBottom line is: I would be really interested to know what my peers think. On the one hand, I really liked the commercial. I found it touching to see something that is discussed in my groups be exposed and supported on a grand scale, with men taking on the responsibility for changing the behavior of other men in our world. On the other hand, many are arguing \u201cwell Gillette still has a pink tax on razors; they only did this as a marketing ploy; as a multi-billion dollar company, one ad doesn\u2019t do much to dismantle the immense power structures that keep our country at status quo.\u201d Some of that I agree with... some of it I don\u2019t. The Forbes article is particularly interesting because the author looks at the issue purely from a Marketing Tactic perspective. His reference to \u201c #LikeaGirl \u201c missed the mark for me. But what do you think? Go watch the commercial and let me know!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#ladybosarts #gillette #feminism #toxicmasculinity #webelieve #likeagirl #thebestamancanbe #socialjustice #genderequality"}}]},"shortcode":"Bss2iuPnRya","edge_media_to_comment":{"count":12,"page_info":{"has_next_page":false,"end_cursor":null},"edges":[{"node":{"id":"17931712894252858","text":"I loved it.

Gillette has been losing market share for quite a few years.  The beard is in and beard maintenance requires more priducts than just razors.  They are also losing to places like the dollar shave club and Harry's and even Schick is making refills to fit Gillette products.  From a personal perspective I wont use another razor other than Gillette Fusion but that is not the case for most people.  Gillette was pushing to be more socially responsible....big with millennials.  Thus garnering a new era of loyal customers, hopefully that qas not their only reason I think they did a great job with the ad.  The only things i have heard as far a negativity ( in my circle 40 to 50 year old men). Was the toxic masculinity phrase and that was a turn off for some and they tuned out.  I have read most of the articles you mention above.  Again my take from business standpoint Gillette may have hurt themselves in the fact that they seem to have aleniated some men...As far as the Pink Tax goes. That one upon first glance seems a little hypocritical.  But again is no so simple from just a numbers approach.  Gillette was solely a male shaving company for a long time.  It is not the case anymore.  However although it is still number 1 in mens it is not when it comes to females.  Gillette is now spending a ton of money on research into female shaving and the fact that it is a much arger area and more complex than men.  Gillette initially would repackage their \"male\" line and sell as female razors.  That is not the case any longer.  For instance the Embrace which is a 5 blade razor...like the Fusion i use is the same in only the 5 blades.  The Embrace howver has a ribbon of moisture, a rounded cartridge, a different more  complicated pivot point, a softer handle with grip points that ergonomically fit what their research showed as to how women shave.  Thus comparing price points is not necessarily apples to apples when you compare just blade number.  As far as the other products go...just a guess but I would say more thought and research has gone into those un recent history thus the higher price","created_at":1547657196,"did_report_as_spam":false,"owner":{"id":"3443599603","is_verified":false,"profile_pic_url":"https://scontent-dus1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2fe0ec1351a947188c9c6480569f22bf/5D390DBF/t51.2885-19/s150x150/24274428_2008835849393182_562588149671264256_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-dus1-1.cdninstagram.com","username":"joepirelli"},"viewer_has_liked":false,"edge_liked_by":{"count":1}}},{"node":{"id":"18008723083106282","text":"@joepirelli it\u2019s just sort of funny cause I know a lot of women who specifically buy men\u2019s razors because they are cheaper and work better, particularly on women with thicker/coarser hair","created_at":1547663348,"did_report_as_spam":false,"owner":{"id":"6572366341","is_verified":false,"profile_pic_url":"https://scontent-dus1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/6c67d35a378ca1365962803e8daef90e/5D31D55C/t51.2885-19/s150x150/47585320_950237362030566_8785922539651072_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-dus1-1.cdninstagram.com","username":"ladybosproductions"},"viewer_has_liked":false,"edge_liked_by":{"count":2}}},{"node":{"id":"17891849533294112","text":"@wendyjehlen I think I totally agree.
