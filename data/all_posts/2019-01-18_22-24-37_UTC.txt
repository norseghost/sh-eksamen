If you’re outraged or feeling defensive about the #Gillette ad, ask yourself why.  What the ad is: a gentle reminder to men to hold one another accountable for abusive and violent behavior, to be better and more compassionate. What it isn’t: an attack on men or on masculine people.  Take a breath.  Is your sense of being a man really so tied up in sexual aggression and violence?  Are you so sensitive to any critique  of masculinity that you can’t take a minute and reflect on how toxic masculinity shows up in your own life?  How it might limit you as a human being? This is something that harms real people (men, women, and gender expansive people) every day. And to the women out there defending your “hubbies” and saying that “women are toxic too!!” — please just stop. You’re not helping anyone. Men and women are socialized differently, and we’re expected to behave differently based on our gender. Not being allowed to cry or feeling like you can’t ask for help when you’re struggling is a part of  why men commit suicide at higher rates than women. There’s much more to say on the subject, and I’m glad that people are having these conversations, but personally I’m bored with the same defensive response.
