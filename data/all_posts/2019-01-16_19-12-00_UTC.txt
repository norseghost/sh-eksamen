~ Feminism: more than just a fashion trend ~
The @gillette ad brought to light the argument of toxic masculinity. WIB has many articles on the subject, and we hope that this discourse truly changes things and makes men more aware. It should not be a fashion trend to talk about it, or an internet sensation. Our article on feminism as a fashion trend, beautifully written by @fribabae , touches on a similar subject. Being aware is key! (Words @vivivigliar )
From the piece: “The main argument against branding feminist messages as a fashion statement is in relation to its trivialising effect; feminism is not something to be bought or sold. Our current consumer society has allowed for monetary transactions to dictate our forms of relatedness; the notion that complex issues such as feminism, racism, and poverty can be solved through monetary exchange.  We thus relate to feminism within a monetary mind-set, we believe we can buy into being a feminist. Feminism stands for much more than a statement on a t-shirt. In its current form, Third Wave Feminism seeks to highlight the multiple or intersectional forms in which women face inequality and discrimination, namely on the grounds that are not only based on gender, but, combined with class position, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, and many other relevant categories.”
