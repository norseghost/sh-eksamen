Have you seen the @gilletteuk advert?
.
The one that saying “Be the best a man can be”. The one that encourages respect of women and bringing up boys and young men to respect women...not think, that as men, they deserve to be treated any different because they have a penis.
.
It also, quietly rightly, says that despite men doing this, there are still men out there that think it’s okay to make rude remarks, grab a woman’s backside and much much worse. This advert encourages other men to call out these men on their inappropriate behaviour and hold each other accountable.
.
And yet, it’s caused an outrage? People aren’t happy with the advert. I don’t get it.
.
I, for one, will be making sure that this little boy grows into a respectful man, that he’s thoughtful, in touch with his feelings and not afraid to express his emotions. That he doesn’t expect more because he’s male but works hard to achieve more because he’s determined and hard working. Every day I tell him, “don’t be the best in the class, just be the best you can be” so I think the @gillette advert is meaningful and effective.
.
Have you seen it? What do you think of it?
