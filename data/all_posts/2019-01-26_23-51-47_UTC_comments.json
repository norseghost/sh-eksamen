What Gillette and your friend is focusing on is toxicity of men rather than addressing the toxicity of both sexes.  The funny thing about the advert is that blokes just want a shave and avoid being nicked.  Unfortunately, Gillette want us men to think that we\u2019re arseholes whilst shaving.  You don\u2019t expect Pretty Polly to advertise their product by telling women not expect a man to pay for everything on a date because equality means equality, therefore spilt the bill.  I wonder how many women would complain.",
