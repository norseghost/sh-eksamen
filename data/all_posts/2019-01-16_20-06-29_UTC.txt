“You shouldn’t be describing your boy as cute, he needs to be tough”

This is what I was told today. My response was to laugh. He is 19 months old soon, a toddler, an innocent. 
This is my son; he is CUTE, he has empathy, laughter, smiles, is gentle, loves music and dancing, he plays with trucks, he plays with dolls, he loves dogs, and he’ll kick a ball with all his might. I would not change one bit of him. He doesn’t need to be tough, but as time goes on he will be taught to be assertive, to stand his ground, to be strong. He will be a good man. 
real men should be able to show emotion without fear of rebuke, and my son makes me proud now and always.
