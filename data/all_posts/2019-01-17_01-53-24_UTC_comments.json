Don\u2019t be mad at us, Heather is a good friend of mine from high school, and we\u2019ve been through a lot.  I know that she has a lot of valuable life experience to share about masculinity in our society, from a lot of positive and negative experiences.  My whole thing is: get the facts about someone before you criticize them, and that we as men need to be accountable for ourselves and for each other.  I get why people are upset with the ad, but I disagree with that argument.  No, not all men are pigs.  But the men who are pigs are causing a shit ton of problems in our world.  We, as good men (I hope I can count on you as one!), need to stand up and say, \u201cMasculinity is about respect.  It\u2019s about kindness.  It\u2019s about defending people who struggle.  It\u2019s about serving people who need help.  Real manliness is about being a good guy, an honest guy, an honorable guy.\u201d That\u2019s what I feel Gillette is trying to say, that men are the best when they are strong, respectful, standing up for what\u2019s good, and being a man of integrity.",
