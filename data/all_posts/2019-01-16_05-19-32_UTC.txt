It's bad enough to see women creating anti-male propaganda; boys don't need to see grown men doing stupid crap like Walk a Mile in Her Shoes or typing social media apology essays to all women who have ever been hurt. Women damn sure aren't going above and beyond for causes such as men's mental health or boys who get molested by female teachers, both of which are rarely talked about without being shut down by misandrists.

When boys are told over and over that males are criminals, and that they need to take responsibility for the rapists, wars, etc. some will end up hating themselves and becoming depressed. This, I can tell you from old experience, as well as from what I've seen with other guys. Considering that suicide is the second highest cause of death for boys aged 15 to 17, and 9th highest for boys up to 14 years old, many of the boys watching today won't live to be the men of tomorrow. Maybe companies like Gillette need to cut down on their toxic masculinity.
