The source report -- released in 2016 -- gives an interesting update for those of you who sent me that 2008 report that stated 70% of abuse is by mothers. 40.3% of victims were abused by a mother acting alone, and 28.4% by the mother with the father and/or nonparent. In cases where the abuse leads to death, mothers make up the majority of perpetrators (27%), which is the figure I accidentally used in reference to general child abuse in the "Is This the Best a Woman Can Be?" meme.
