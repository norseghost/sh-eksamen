Gillette made a commercial suggesting that men could be better. 
It illustrated “toxic masculinity” through examples such as a young boy being bullied by other boys, sexual harassment, catcalling, and a man speaking over a woman in a meeting. 
The men in the advert, who end the commercial by breaking up fights, stopping their friends from making women uncomfortable, and generally behaving decently, seem like great guys. The commercial implies that this should be the new model where men held other men accountable for their actions. Sounds okay to us. 
Then why was the hashtag #BoycottGillette trending on Twitter and why was the ad accused of being "anti-men”? Toxic masculinity is a narrow and repressive description of manhood, designating manhood as defined by violence, sex, status and aggression. It’s the cultural ideal of manliness, where strength is everything while emotions are a weakness; where sex and brutality are yardsticks by which men are measured, while supposedly “feminine” traits—which can range from emotional vulnerability to simply not being hypersexual—are the means by which your status as “man” can be taken away.
