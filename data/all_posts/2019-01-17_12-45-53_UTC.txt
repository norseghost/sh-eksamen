Within 1 hour of the #thebestamancanbe launch, dislikes outranked likes on the YouTube video 10:1. 🤔
Brilliant ad. Timely message.  Why was it so vehemently hated?! Because men don’t like being called out for being the pieces of shit that they are. #thatwaseasy 
Fathers of daughters dating and lying to multiple women at a time in secret and then boasting with fervent bravado “anyone who hurts my little girl is going to have to answer to me!”
Really?! Reallllyyy??!! What, so you two can share trade secrets?! She chose someone to hurt her because that’s what’s familiar to her. 🤦‍♀️ #duh 
#MeToo wasn’t born from women sitting around the nail salon saying - “we have nothing better to do so let’s do this.”
It was born from women being sick and tired of being groped, and and objectified, categorized, sexualized.  All. The. Time. 
If I’m on a date and my body language is facing the bar and my eyes are on the TV and clock occasionally glancing at you, permission to touch me is NOT granted. 
Yet they think because I’m on a date it’s ok. ITS NOT. 
Men - do you know what macho, arrogant, player and cocky translates to for women?!!! Unaddressed insecurities that will play out through verbal, emotional or physical abuse, addictions and of course and always cheating. 
No grown respectable woman wants a little boy on men’s clothing. 
And what we just witnessed through this ad and the ferocious attack by men is how many are still out there. 
So many men who attack as default. 
So YES of course they’re doing it to us on a daily basis. All. The. Time. 
So in closing of this little ted talk, @gillette , keep reminding men to step up and out of the shadows of arrogance and step I got the spotlight of confidence. 
And PS: don’t forget to stop charging women the #pinktax. 🙄🤷‍♀️
