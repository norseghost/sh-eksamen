Dear all the "not all men" men: Please try and recognise the privilege you have in that whilst you're busy getting defensive and complaining about semantics, we are busy campaigning about trying not to get sexually assaulted, harassed, abused, murdered, degraded, ignored, gas-lighted, objectified, under-paid, forced into marriage, sold into sex slavery, genital-mutilated, to help men be more comfortable with showing vulnerability thus improving mental health, to get equal maternity and paternity leave, to put baby-changers in all bathrooms, to make sex more satisfying for everyone... the list is endless.

We need more male allies in feminism, because ALL MEN benefit from it.
