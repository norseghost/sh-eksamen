When you read between the lines, what do you see? 🖐🏽 I try to keep my nose out of the comments sections, in general, but the uproar over this razor commercial has made me curious. Funny how some folks are quick to feel persecuted over something which says no more to me than “call out dickhead behaviour.” The concept of toxic masculinity has been frightfully misunderstood by many, which is such a shame bc I feel like we call it out now for the good of everyone. If I have a son, I’d want him to grow up in a world where he can feel free to define masculinity for himself - and not be offended by being told not to “harass” people - even if that message comes in the form of a shaving advert. 🤦🏼‍♀️#smdfh 
When we are active in choosing our reactions and interpretations, why do you think people choose offense?
