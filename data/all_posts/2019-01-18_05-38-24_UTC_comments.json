This isn't just about sexual harassment or rape. It's also about the toxic views of masculinity that prevent men from having healthy emotional discussions. Reaching out for professional help without being seen as a \"pussy\". Men and boys not being bullied or mocked for not fitting traditional male stereotypes. That's ALL toxic masculinity and all of it needs to stop. \nWhy not go help with that rather than troll the internet for women to blame your problems on.",
