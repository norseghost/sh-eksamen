The same applies for the \u00b4don\u00b4t respond this\u00b4. You are no entitled to finish a conversation as you wish, like if you just pick up the ball and left the game and your fellow players without the ball and the right to go on with the game. It\u00b4s unbeliveable sad how you keep doing, unshamely, the same thing we are criticizing, bottom line. And cancer is what killed my grandpa. The fight against any toxic behavour that hurts humanity and delay it\u00b4s path to balance and a fair life for everyone is called fight for civilization, not disease. Have a good life.",

It seems that your aproach does not consider that masculinity, toxic or healthy, is strucutural in our society, so, yes, it's totally logic and without prejudice to portrait men, in general, as social group, and as group of hegemony in power, as performers of toxic masculinity, even if, in an individual basis, there is a spectrum of this performance, from 0,1 to 100%. This the meaning of the #NotAllMen concept-critical, that when some man does not acknowledge that there's a structural misogyny and sexism (against the non-male, as women, gay, etc) in society, saying 'but not all men performs/act like that' as if it was about one or himself, these men are in denial. What's is sad and just delay the fight against the sexist ad mysoginous behaviours we are calling men to fight with us.",

Taking the negative behavior of a small number of people and then holding a much much larger group collectively accountable simply because they share a gender with the people is sexist. It\u2019s not about being offended or not. It\u2019s about calling it out for what it is. What is wrong with you how can you not see this. If gillete made an ad asking black people to stop mugging each other would you be saying I don\u2019t get it they are asking black people to be decent human being?",
