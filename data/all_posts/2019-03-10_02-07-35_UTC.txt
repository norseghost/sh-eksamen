Someone got this tattoo today - the same as mine - to support me and women everywhere. I didn’t ask him to do this and I asked him more than once if he was sure and he was. He wanted to let us know that we aren’t alone and isn’t that the best display of what a man can be. #imsolucky #thebestamancanbe #feminism #myhusband #thegreatestlove
