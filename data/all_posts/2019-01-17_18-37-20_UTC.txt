This is a blog post that I wrote a while back but I believe that it’s worth revisiting in light of #boycottegillette -
For the first 34 years of my life, I survived by projecting toxic masculinity and clinging to the privilege afforded to me by my place in the patriarchy. -
I still miss that privilege, but it’s not like I’m lacking in that area as a white, suburban, passable binary trans woman.
-
I’m currently working on a new blog post, but in the meantime, please enjoy this one.
