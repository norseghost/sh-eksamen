It’s the eyes- tough guys can also be good guys. During the shoot, this fella told me how every now and then he would catch himself standing with his arms crossed and would change his posture so that he did not appear unapproachable. He’s a good guy and quite approachable. It doesn’t mean he’s not a tough guy. I doubt he ever used a Gillette product, and I’d bet he’s not going to start now, and neither will I.  The fact of the matter is I know plenty of tough men, strong men, good men. Men who will stand up for what is right. Men who will intercede, men who will sacrifice their own lives. Men who are...overlooked and they’re okay with that, because that’s the way real men are. #goodman #beard #realmen #boycottgillette #portrait #kindness  #discoverportrait #strength #blackandwhite #blackandwhitephotography #portraitphotography #profile_vision #postmoreportraits #portraitpage #igpodium_portraits #portraiture #makeportraits #makeportraitsnotwar #quietthechaos #makeportraitsmag #humaneffect #portrait_perfection #agameofportraits #sonyimages #sonyalpha #bealpha #becoming
