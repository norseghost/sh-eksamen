As a man if this ad offends you then I think you need to question your so called manhood... The day and time we all learn how to RESPECT other humans regardless of their Gender, race, religious, political affiliation is the day we will win as humans and we wount need such ads. ....and IMO the ad calling on the very many of us who are 'bad' doesn't make all men bad it's just calling on us to hold all of us accountable for our actions. Plain and simple! 
The ad might not be the best thing to ever happen or the best ad out there but it's a start... A great start that triggers the relevant conversations we needed to have had ages ago!!! IT'S ONLY BY CHALLENGING OURSELVES TO DO MORE THAT WE CAN GET CLOSER TO OUR BEST!!! #TheBestAManCanBe
