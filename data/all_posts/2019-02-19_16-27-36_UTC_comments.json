If it were feminism would be call equalism or masculinism or more likely just wouldn\u2019t be a thing? I don\u2019t understand why men think feminism is useless and unneeded when women would literally still be stuck with no voting rights, sexual health rights, human rights, property etc etc etc without it. Which proves your statement to be wrong. Also, femininity isn\u2019t violent against masculinity. Women presidents don\u2019t go around joking about sexually harassing men and grabbing dicks for fun. The patriarchy doesn\u2019t make life difficult or scary for men in any mwah the way it does for women. Please tell me how femininity is ruining men\u2019s lives all over the world ?",

Because if men loved women, every time this topic were brought up I wouldn\u2019t have to keep defending the fact that a struggle even exists for women, ir explaining how femininity is not as toxic as masculinity, which like I already said, if it were genuinely as toxic, then feminism would be called equalism, or it would be called masculism, or more likely it just wouldn\u2019t be a thing. If it weren\u2019t a deep rooted hatred then the reactions against this video wouldn\u2019t be anger and violent words, when the video is NOT saying that all men are bad or rapists. It\u2019s hurtful. And I think it\u2019s so hurtful because I\u2019ve had 26 years of hearing horrible things comes out of the mouths of men I love, and the worst part is they never even realize it care about how much it hurts. Instead, their ego is more important. Just like every man angry about this commercial. (Also I\u2019m genuinely not trying to be insulting, this is honestly how I feel and I\u2019d like men to be understanding)",

The reason there would never be an ad like this for women is because men never needed an entire movement to stop violence against men, or to gain the right to vote, or to own their own property. It\u2019s called FEMinism because women have been hurt by the patriarchy for a very long time. If you care about and love women, then this commercial shouldn\u2019t be offensive.
