Not sure if this is legit, but this watch company made a response to Gillette ad. It is is on YouTube. It shows all the stats showing how men suffer...you know, all the ways society and toxic masculinity harms men (child custody discrepancies, violent deaths, high homeless rate and suicide rates)? It says they believe in men. 
Funny...I haven’t seen dozens of posts of women smashing these watches in protest.  Because the stats in the ad are true, and they are awful. Just like the problems that Gillette address are true, and awful. 
Which is why toxic masculinity needs to be dismantled by men as as well as women. 
I think this ad appeals to the Gillette boycotters because it ONLY focuses on how toxic masculinity hurts men (of course it doesn’t call it toxic masculinity). It doesn’t show how it hurts women-the Gillette ad showed both, and somehow got translated into “being a man means you are toxic”.
