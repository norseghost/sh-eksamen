Just published at Dailyskier.com ***BEARD, THE BEST A MAN CAN GET*** Since everybody & his dog are discussing Gillette's (successful ) attempt at stirring the pot , we have decided to jump on that bandwagon too.

We have no idea whether a beard these days is supposed to be a nod towards "toxic masculinity" or any such.

We merely present you beard fashions on the top of international skiing. Whether they are in dire need of Gillette or otherwise - you decide.  #crosscountry #Gillette #Gros #Pellegrino #Sundby #Ustiugov #xcski #xcskibeard #лыжныегонки #adGillette #boycottGillette #nordic #crosscountry @matt.d.whitcomb
