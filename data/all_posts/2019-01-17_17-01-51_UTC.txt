Surprisingly at one time they produced a series of programs to provide men the knowledge of how to be good men. If you need instruction on how to treat women, children and other men I believe all the seasons are on amazon. As for @gillette your political ad does not make up for your decades of corny macho dudes in showers. Congrats on also stereotyping men bbqâ€™ing in your ad. FYI- My wife and daughter can out-grill everyone at your sushi catered board meetings. #whyiseverythingpoltical #macho #masculine #goodmen #fathers #sons #americahaslostitsmind #corporate #propaganda #loonies #manhate #andytaylor #mayberry #lifelessons #boycottgillette
