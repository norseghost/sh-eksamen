My wife was visibly distressed last night from some of the information that came to light from the murder of Aiia. This got me thinking about the likes, shares and comments I'd seen over the last few days trying to put #boycottgillette in a positive light. These comments I'd seen had overwhelmingly been on LinkedIn, which is why I put the linked post on there this morning.  Frankly, I have very little reach on that platform and since I feel strongly about this issue I link to it here as well. I want there to be no confusion as to how I feel about this issue. Both as a father and a business owner. #equality #equalrights #dadanddaughter #gillette #bethechange #dad #progressive #business
