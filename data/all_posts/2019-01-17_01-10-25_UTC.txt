Let’s take a moment to talk about this..
Hundreds of thousands of men are furious and outraged by this “feminist propaganda” and that #gillette have “made it clear they do not want the business of masculine men”
Hello? This is an #ad that was created by a man for a male dominated company, aimed at men. There’s no feminist propaganda here. And I sincerely hope bullying and sexual harassment isn’t what constitutes a “masculine man”. Myself and a lot of my friends and colleagues have been harassed/assaulted BADLY by men and I’m still not a “man hater”, we simply want to spread a message that that kind of behaviour isn’t ok.
This is a company geared at men that has utilised the opportunity of globally having men’s attention to emphasise a very important message. A lot of men are inherently good and as good people it’s your/our duty to call up bad behaviour and do the right thing. Not painting all men with the same brush, just saying “hey, let’s all be our better selves, stand up to bad behaviour and educate people” 
So please, everyone who is offended by this advertisement, please open your eyes, turn off the tv and go outside. If you think men have been painted in a certain way, lead by example to change that and go do some good.
