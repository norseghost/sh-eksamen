Gillette's target are man, so their ad is about Catcalling, mansplaning, bullying, because that's what \"toxic masculinity\" means. Seriously, are you incapable of telling the difference between this term and the strong, pure masculinity (standing up for woman, teaching daughters to be strong, teaching their sons that they are no troglodytes, and violence is not the only options, helping weaker ones). It's really not a quantum mechanics, I think.",

Just because feminist would like to lump men into one big category doesn't make it a real thing. When I'm around a rapist I don't become a rapist. Same as if I'm around racist, pedophiles, abusers, etc.  I don't magical become one. There are weak willed men, just like there are weak willed women that fall in line and do what there friends do.",
