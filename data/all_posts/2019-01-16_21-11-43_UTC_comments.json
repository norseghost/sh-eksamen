It\u2019s making us into enemies with each other. Third wave feminism is pure hate and evil. It\u2019s NOT about equality...if it were it would recognize just MORE privledged women are in today\u2019s society than men.\n.\nThat\u2019s what you can tell your \u201cfriend\u201d",

For a grant total of 1,400 all together (being generous, that and not including my first high school, which had roughly 1,000 3yrs ago, I\u2019d say it\u2019s up to 1,300 but I\u2019ll just keep it at which it was when we tested it) roughly 55% were females and 45% was males. Let\u2019s just say 50/50 for simpler math. So that is obviously 700 males and females. Well we did a study. Out of 700 females who have been sexually assaulted or raped (this includes  unwanted advancements that are obviously included in sexual harassment) 623 young ladies said that this happened to them. Not including the ones who were too scared to admit. Which we later added over 40, because of this reason. Bringing the total to a horrible 663 young ladies. We asked the men \u201chave they ever been raped, or sexually harassed\u201d 3 came forward. And they were already open about it. No one came forward in secrecy. We asked them, \u201chas anyone been falsely accused of rape or sexual harassment?\u201d One did, but it turned out, with evidence through court, he was lying. We ask \u201chow many of you have been asked a girl multiple times until she said yes to have any sexual interactions\u201d 562 raised they hands. A staggering 96 more, came forward, and admitted they did, but felt horrible. But wait. It gets worse",

The tv portion I saw, was a man sexually harassing a women, which is not ok, it showed a man making a horrible remark to a women in a bikini, then another man standing up for her. Play fighting is pushing, or rolling on the ground, those kids were hitting each other, almost punching, which is not play fighting. I took the men doing good things in the opposite way, I thought it showed that most men are doing good things, and everyone needs to work together to stop the bad ones. I do believe they should have shown that women do bad things in the commercial also, but their main demographic is men",

If it\u2019s not real fighting, girls do this too. That\u2019s just another stereotypical scene which was unnecessary.\n\nThe advert also made reference to how some men are already acting the way they should.... Rather than saying only some men are good, (Implying the majority are bad), they should say the opposite, only some men are bad (and acknowledge most are decent human beings) that is what has got people\u2019s backs up the most.\n\nThen they stereotyped men as being big dumb oafs stood behind barbecues, that\u2019s not okay either.\n\nA lot of feminists seem to think if we don\u2019t like the advert then we are all for bad behaviour, when actually we don\u2019t like poor antics either but we dislike the way men have been portrayed and masculinity as a whole.
