Yesterday I finished a class focused on Race, Gender, and Representation. Today I watched the new Gillette ad about violent masculinity. Funny how those two coincided.
💠
The idea of masculinity as we know it dates back before the Roman Empire, that does not mean it is right...That was also a time when women were bought and sold as property and we don’t do that anymore 🤷🏼‍♀️
💠
It is important to be aware, as a culture we are fully responsible for the actions of our people. In this I mean, if we raise boys with the “boys will be boys” mentality, then they will continue to be violent and close-minded. The same close-mindedness that @gillette is up against with this new campaign.
💠
If we really want to make a change, we need to change how advertising represents both men and women. We need to change the way we treat each other, no matter what race or gender or class you are.
💠
People are people. I have taken my stance. I will not be afraid to stand up against toxic masculinity. Thank you @gillette for making this beautiful short film and holding a mirror up to our culture. #thebestamancanbe #gillette
