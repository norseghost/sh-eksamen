This is a problem men are dealing with all the time now in society, false rape accusations. Men can be simply accused of rape and still be prosecuted without any evidence of wrong doing. In lots of cases if even the accusations are proven false, the damage outside of the law could be just as bad, it’s enough to ruin a man’s reputation, job, friends, and life. You may wonder if the accuser gets punished for these false claims, the answer is no. Legally there is no charge against them and usually the most that happens can be a civil lawsuit, this is a problem and it needs to be dealt with, we live in a society where all men are seen as evil and cruel, it’s time for everyone to wake up and discuss these issues.
