Back to Gillette! 😂 #yallmissunderstoodthedamnthingcalmdown #thebestamancanbe  #gillette But for real though: “Hegemonic masculinity is defined as a practice that legitimizes powerful men's dominant position in society and justifies the subordination of the common male population and women, and other marginalized ways of being a man.” THAT is what they were saying needs to go. Ok I’m done... lol
