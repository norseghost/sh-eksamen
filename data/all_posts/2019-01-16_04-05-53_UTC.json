The fact I had to pull this shot from @gq for a proper snapshot of this new ad is a shame in itself. Nothing against @gq, but it was the only place I could find a neutral perspective about the commercial that\u2019s making headlines today. The negative outcry from men on this ad is truly disappointing & further reflects our disconnect with each other.  @terrycrews words \u201cmen need to keep men accountable\u201d is a notion that has helped me develop to become the man I am today. 10 years ago I committed to a #mensministry that introduced me to my brothers from @lwachinoca. These men have all contributed to my development & inspire me to live as a #manofgod. I\u2019m far from where I desire to be, but I know that with my brothers around me, the confidence of my wife @celestlarue, & the unfailing grace & love of #thelord I\u2019m growing closer every day to the man that God\u2019s called me to be. @gillette - thank you for challenging the status quo, thank you for encouraging men to require more of themselves, & thank you for being a brand bold enough to stand on principles greater than selling a commodity.

It seems  to be more generational as opposed to political in this case. To me it just seems like Gillette is trying to sell more razors to millennials by being topical and riding the coat tails of the #metoo movement. It seems a bit pandering to me, but that\u2019s just my opinion. I have to agree that It\u2019s smart marketing because it\u2019s low hanging fruit and will appeal to the market they are going after. I disagree with it being bold, if anything it\u2019s safe to error on the side of political correctness. I would say that bold was the move Nike made with Colin Kaepernick. They new that that was political and could be far more polarizing. Either way, I respect your opinion and understand how soft your generation is \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.

The truth is your generation is soft, but not because of grace, empathy and love. Those are all attributes that every man should embrace. It is soft because the people of the generation can\u2019t hear opinions without being made to feel uncomfortable and immediately try to cling to a moral high ground, kind of like you just did. Great things come from being challenged, great things come from discomfort and strife. I too have a daughter and I will teach her to love and be empathetic. I will also teach her to be accountable to herself and do the right thing because it is the right thing to do.

I just watched it..and will read some of the editorial pieces later....but after watching the commercial\u2014I think its GREAT and see no problem with it. In fact, I felt it was a bit inspiring. (Yes-from a razor commercial). I dont care if it was \u201cselling\u201d dogfood, soda, water or any product. Conscious minds, like minded people choose to make it & to use the platform to say something impactful & positive.

Whats wrong with people becoming conscious of things that the previous generations did not or becoming more aware of. Evolvement is a never-ending process. Stagnation is Death.
