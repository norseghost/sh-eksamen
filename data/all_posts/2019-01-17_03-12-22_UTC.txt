Gillette's new ad isn't about shaving. It's about men in the age of the #metoo movement. It’s controversial and has sparked a lot of conversation on social today. I think we need more conversation and if it falls on the marketing team to give a voice to issues then I will gladly take that on.

I’m all for campaigns that are purpose focused. I posted a while back on the Nike Colin Kapernack campaign another great piece of work that puts purpose before profit, bringing brand loyalists even closer.
