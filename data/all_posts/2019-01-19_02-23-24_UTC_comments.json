If he doesn\u2019t have control what\u2019s to stop him from killing or hurting the kids. And you\u2019re absolutely right about the single parents part but if a boy or girl are raised by just their mother or father their chances of doing drugs and crime dramatically increase, a great example of that is black people. And I don\u2019t mean to be racist and just to clarify in case you didn\u2019t know, black people make up 30% of America yet they commit 70% of the crime, another thing that have is that 90% of black families are missing a father.

That\u2019s why we need more masculinity in kids not less, I don\u2019t know how a woman feels or how I can possibly raise them, and a woman won\u2019t know how a man feels, that\u2019s what fathers and mothers are for.

But anyway back on track, be wary though some of the dates and numbers might be off and I can\u2019t remember names if my life depended on it so I\u2019m going to call the main characters bob and dill.\nSo in the 1980\u2019s I believe there was this one doctor who at the time wondered if gender truly was a social construct. He wanted to test it out on boys since he couldn\u2019t put a male penis on a girl, since the procedure was completely unethical he did the experiment illegally. When he saw 2 twin boys who had a problem with their penises he took that opportunity to burn their penises beyond surgical repair, he told the parents he accidentally burned them and told them that the best option was to dress them up as girls and give them estrogen pills, and to never tell the kids that they were boys. The parents of course listened and after 8 years of treating them as girls and giving them the estrogen pills bob and dill started having symptoms of trauma and the boys started acting wierdly as if they had some mental disorders, it was u til the age of 12 where they started to get really fucked up, they were extremely mentally challenged so badly that they thought the parents had beat them for years, and weirdly they chose that time to tell Dan and Bob that they were boys instead of girls, after this they started to get better little by little but it wasn\u2019t enough and Dan and Bob committed suicide in their cars at the age of 18.",

I think there was a misconception I am not saying men shouldn\u2019t have masculine jobs, or like sports, but they also shouldn\u2019t be forced to because it is masculine. Bullying is a problem that help, it causes suicide, and serious mental health problems. Catcalling is also a problem, saying hello is not catcalling, but being to led to smile, or that you have nice boobs, or ass is, and it should not happen. It was necessary in those times for men to not show emotion, but it is not part of you genetics, you can help it, and teach the next generation it is ok. Teaching boys it is ok to cry will not mess them up mentally, if anything it will help them. Hope you have a nice day, also!",

        "text": "The no emotion thing is something that we carried on as evolution progressed, it was mainly because we were built for hunting and many men died as they hunted, if we were not to have this trait then, well most of the men there would have been unable to hunt and that would have caused many problems. So that is something we cannot help. And you can\u2019t change evolution by saying you can cry whenever you want, it\u2019s going to screw them up mentally. The traditional male jobs is because most women don\u2019t want to do those jobs, we aren\u2019t holding you back it\u2019s your decision if you want to do that. Plus men are more likely to take risk and they even tend to like it, or they just really like the job. Bullying is not just a masculine trait, if you think that we can live in a world without bullying you\u2019re living in a fantasy plus the way the child acts is the parents who raised them fault and  partially the kids. I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with liking sports, you\u2019re out there to have fun. And with the catcalling thing,(just in case you think this way) just because a man says hello to you randomly or good morning is not cat calling he\u2019s just polite. Have a good day.",
