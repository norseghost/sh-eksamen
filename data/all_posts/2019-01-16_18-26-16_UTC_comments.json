The way we treat rape as a whole needs to change, but for things to change people need to be aware. If no one makes any effort to tell people about the truth of things, other people will have to stand up and make peopl take notice. This company is simply standing up when centuries of others have decided not too. And personally, i say its about time. Since the beginning of time people have decided that women are the ones that are the property. Despite them having the same flesh, eyes, hair, heart and intestines and lungs. Humans are all the same, and have a special tendency to repeat history. Its about time we changed. Opinions can be opinions, and people have the right of free speech. But the moment someones speech goes against anyone in any way, thats when you need to rethink it.",

So  we cannot possibly know what Anthony would make of today's debate over the abortion issue, because the terms do not translate. In answer to the position that Anthony was pro-life, she never voiced an opinion about the sanctity of fetal life\u00a0and she never voiced an opinion about using the power of the state to require that pregnancies be brought to term. Gloria Feldt, a former head of\u00a0Planned Parenthood, said of Anthony that \"there's absolutely nothing in anything that she ever said or did that would indicate she was anti-abortion.\" Law professor Tracy Thomas, writing in the\u00a0Seattle University Law Review, said the \"strategy of creating a narrative of feminist history against abortion\" was developed by Feminists for Life in the early 1990s. Thomas published a lengthy analysis of what she considered to be inaccuracies in that narrative, saying, \"... the narrative is simply not true. Sound bites that have been excised from history are taken out of context to convey a meaning not originally intended.\" She quoted Annette Ravinsky, a former vice president of the FFL turned pro-choice advocate, as saying in published comments, \"I really wish my former colleagues would stop twisting the words of dead people to make them mean something they don't ... The early leaders of the women's movement were not against women controlling their bodies.\"",

Fertilized eggs exist: they're just as they have been fertilized. And by the way I'm not pro abortion I'm pro-choice there's a big difference. In fact there are many people who are pro choice and anti abortion. The pro choice movement is about giving women choice regardless of your own personal beliefs on abortion. So if you don't agree with abortion that's ok; I don't care. But to stop other woman from getting abortions takes away women's bodily autonomy and freedom. Which is the exact opposite of feminism.",

There are two articles that fake feminists love to ignore or reinterpret. In her March 12, 1868 Revolution periodical, the title of the article is: \u201cChild Murder\u201d. It goes on to say: \u201cThere must be a remedy even for such a crying evil as this\u2026.there were four hundred murders annually produced by abortion in that county alone.\u201d Hmmm, she seems pretty definitive about abortion. Also, in her July 8, 1869 Revolution OpEd, she states this: \u201cMuch as I deplore the horrible crime of child-murder [see, there it is AGAIN], earnestly as I desire its suppression, I cannot believe with the writer of the above mentioned article, that such a law would have the desired effect. It seems to be only mowing off the top of the noxious weed, while the root remains.\u00a0We want prevention, not merely punishment. We must reach the root of the evil, and destroy it.\u201d Anthony\u2019s take on marriage is coupled with her belief that men are just as guilty of the the \u201ccrime\u201d of abortion, saying: \u201cGuilty? Yes, no matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed. It will burden her conscience in life, it will burden her soul in death; but oh! thrice guilty is he who, for selfish gratification, heedless of her prayers, indifferent to her fate, drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime.\u201d The links to downloadable copies of these issues of Revolution are here: Radiance.life/fakefeminism",

Gordon, a leading academic authority on Anthony,\u00a0has criticized the effort to represent Anthony as someone who would support the modern anti choice movement, saying, \"The result is what historians call 'invented memory'\u2014history without foundation in the evidence but with modern utility.\" Gordon said that Anthony \"never voiced an opinion about the sanctity of fetal life\u00a0... and she never voiced an opinion about using the power of the state to require that pregnancies be brought to term.\" 2) it isn't child murder. Firstly people don't get pregnant with the intention intention of killing; that's murder. Secondly, by your logic if a fertilised egg is a human technically every woman is a murderer. Because two thirds of the time, fertilized eggs don't embed in the uterus and instead are expelled from the body through the period which would technically make a women a murderer in your eyes\nsince she is 'killing a child'.",

I have been to PP myself (I'm formerly pro choice) and have researched their work in depth and found that it is false that they provide prenatal care, they do not and have never provided mamograms (even though Cecile Richards said they did on CNN in 2011) and they do have abortion quotas. For every 1 PP there are 20 federally qualified health providers that women can go to in the US and receive quality care. Women have died in the \"care\" of Planned Parenthood after what they were told would be a \"safe\" abortion.  I agree with you in that I want health care access for all women, but we do not need PP in order to achieve that.",

They do breast exams and teach young women how to correctly self examine their breasts. They DO do Pap smears on site, I got one there two weeks ago. And when I was pregnant, THEY gave me hope. They confirmed my home test results, took the time to answer all my questions, and gave me tons of resources to help me. At NO point did they push an abortion, they never even brought up the option. It was for me to inquire if that was my decision.
