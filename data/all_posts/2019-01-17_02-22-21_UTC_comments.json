And that is not to say, the commercial was only regarding of treatment of women, but society as a whole. The point was for men to hold other men accountable, to teach the young boys that bullying and physically assaulting one another is not okay, and for all men to lead by example. At no point, did they say ALL men, and if you took anything away from this commercial than that, you may be part of the issue. It\u2019s directed towards men, because razors are typically a male driven product. And if you think after the #metoo movement, that sexual harassment is still not an issue, you are sadly mistaken. I get comments regularly about my breasts, or other physical features by complete strangers. Is this acceptable because I chose to work in a bar? NO!
