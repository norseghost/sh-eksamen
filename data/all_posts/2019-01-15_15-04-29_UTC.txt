THE STATE OF MEN'S CULTURE.

Gillette is under fire after releasing an advert that draws upon the #MeToo movement to challenge "bullying," "sexual harassment" and "toxic masculinity," - with a question: "Is this the best a man can get?".
.
The campaign encouraged men to hold one another accountable for their behavior. However the YouTube video, which has been viewed more than 4.1 million times, currently has almost 366K dislikes.

Did Gillette mistakenly insult its primary customers or was the ad meant to provoke a healthy debate on men's culture? .
