        "text": "hello. valley center middle school has a kid that has been making threats to shoot up the school since monday this week and the school won\u2019t do anything about it. the kid is a major trump supporter that believes he is trump\u2019s son and is also a known racist that called my black cousin a n*gger. the child has said that the first person he is targeting is the girl who rejected him. my mother and i went to talk to the superintendent about the situation and he said \u201cwould you want us to kick your daughter out if she was making threats?\u201d he changed the subject when we brought up the point of MY sister and cousin being afraid to attend school BECAUSE of their SKIN COLOR. this is not right. so many children have come forward about their fear to come to school because of this kid making threats still. it\u2019s raining and we just pulled my sister out for the day because all the students were put into one building. my sister just told me that her friends and her were already figuring out the best places to hide. can you please help spread the word about this disgusting situation?",
