        "text": "Interesting take on this topic. I think the trigger for me was the broad brush with which they painted. I\u2019m a loving father of daughters and about as alpha male as you can get. Personally I feel that men as a whole are not as depicted in the ad. That\u2019s the hurtful part. Men who have spent a life defending others and treating women with love and respect feel attacked by the ad. My initial response the first time I saw it was that I don\u2019t need a lecture from Gillette to be a good person, and those that are crappy men will not be affected by a Gillette ad.",
