Toxic masculinity ————————————— When most people talk about toxic masculinity, they do not mean masculinity is toxic. What we mean is specific things associated with masculinity is toxic, such as: bullying, violence, showing no emotion, not crying, having to like sports, having to do traditional male jobs, disrespecting others, catcalling. We do not want people to stop being masculine, we want to stop these things associated with masculinity, and stop using gender as an excuse. ————————————— #mensrights #mensrightsactivist #mensrightsmovement #feminism #meninism #feminist #gillete #boycottgillette #toxicmasculinity #masculinity #catcalling #metoo #commercial #empowerment #men #women #boys #girls
