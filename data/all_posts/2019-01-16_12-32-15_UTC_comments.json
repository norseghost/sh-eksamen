Also, read up on how the army treated women once they were allowed. Bullying and rape of women in the army have been widely documented, including the fact that the army didn\u2019t do squat to stop it.

Ex- go on a date all dolled up for dinner, hair makeup etc. I had a guy say that I looked too high maintenance for him.  Another date I asked a guy to go to a shooting range with me. I put on makeup and he made fun of me. Another date went rock climbing so I was in gym clothes and no makeup. He said he liked girls that tried a little harder and said I\u2019d be prettier with makeup and my hair curled. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f can\u2019t win . And men aren\u2019t required to do anything. I\u2019ve requested that a man trim his beard up and I was called shallow. I requested that a man wear a nicer pearlsnap shirt because I was wearing a cute dress and cowgirl boots. And when we make the requests we\u2019re typically told to F off. (Disclaimer this is more with younger boys under the age of 30. Older men I\u2019ve found to typically dress nicer. And I\u2019m not saying all boys either)",

Much like going to the mall and shopping, getting your nails and hair done, and getting all dressed up to go out are girls things.. there\u2019s nothing wrong with these stereotypes, because they\u2019re predominately correct. Is it a 100% of the time thing..? No, but i would say it\u2019s a 95% of the time sorta thing. And yes, more masculine than most of the women I know. Is that a bad thing? Nope. Do you. Do whatever makes you happy, but don\u2019t put people down for being who they are. I\u2019m a masculine guy, is that a bad thing? Nope. I have gat friends who aren\u2019t masculine guys.. they will openly admit that. They don\u2019t like any of the stuff I like to do, and that\u2019s okay, but they don\u2019t put me down for being masculine. We just like different things. That\u2019s just the way it is.",

I can see both sides. If we, women, were portrayed in a similar manner in an ad there would we outrage for sure and it would be talked about in all the social media. The same should be expected in the case of men. On the other hand, I do understand what Gillette wanted to do (even though they poorly executed it). As someone else commented, they just wanted to bring awareness. Yes, not all men are rapists. Not all men are bullies. Not all men are as aggressive. But some men are. Otherwise domestic abuse in women wouldn\u2019t be more than twice as high than in men. Rape of women wouldn\u2019t be one in five, and in men just one in 71. Yes, women do falsely accuse people of rape. I don\u2019t know how fucked up you have to be to do that but they do. However, the number of women who are too afraid to even talk about them being raped and come forward are far more. What I am trying to say is, that as a woman, I can see both sides. And I agree with what you men are trying to say. However, it isn\u2019t okay to discriminate either gender. Women have had rough times and at times, sorry to say, harder then men. It is a fact. And if you\u2019re not a woman you can\u2019t possibly understand or have an absolute opinion on the matter - that would make you ignorant. But the same goes for us women, we cannot possibly understand what it is to be a man, and shouldn\u2019t always try and bite some man\u2019s head off when they are just simply trying to defend themselves. Not all men are bad, as not all women are bad. There are some wonderful men out there, and true heroes. That is my opinion anyways. And before people \u2018attack\u2019 me for it, it is just that, my opinion.",

Taught to respect one and other and be kind. They didn't show pictures of these men and say that we should change that. They were trying to show that the men that bully and belittle need to make a change for the younger generation. Not all men are blamed for the actions of bad men, it may feel that way, but if a man is good, he knows that he is good. And men as a whole will never be praised or blamed because men are not all the same. The overall point of the ad is that men need to stop the men that are bullying show them what is right.
