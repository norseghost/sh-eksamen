Thank you @gillette, for standing for compassion and empathy in the face of insecurity and hate. This is not about being ‘man’ enough. Vulnerability does not make you weak. It is your best strength. It is about human beings standing up for fellow human beings. We are more than our biology. #thebestamancanbe #gillette
