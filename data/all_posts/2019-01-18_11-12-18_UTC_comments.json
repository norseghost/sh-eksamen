It was a very uplifting, positive ad. It showed how men can make a positive difference with other men who are dangerous and abusive.",

Also, I like how that one guy mentioned fatherhood in the black community or Muslims mistreating women because he is still pointing to instances in which toxic masculinity is a problem. But he wants to make it about race and not about toxic masculinity. Even in the ad, there were Good Men. So to act as if the ad was saying all men are toxic is simply dishonest.",
