Like @Nike's support of @kaepernick7 and free speech, and Dove supporting real beauty, I applaud any brand that puts purpose before profit. "Itâ€™s time we acknowledge that brands, like ours, play a role in influencing culture. And as a company that encourages men to be their best, we have a responsibility to make sure we are promoting positive, attainable, inclusive and healthy versions of what it means to be a man." There's a link in my bio to the full video. @gillette #TheBestAManCanBe #Leadership #CorporateResponsibility
