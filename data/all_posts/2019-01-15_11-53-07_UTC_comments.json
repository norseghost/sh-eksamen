        "text": "@168tmk i think thats the miss understanding between us, I don't think any group of people should be shamed for anything unless as a whole they are doing wrong or corrupt things (criminals & etc.). I just see it as acknowledging what you're doing that could be inconvenient to others, and then trying to fix that behavior. I don't necessarily see it as \"you're horrible. Stop everything.\" Just that as a whole try to be better if your lacking a little and that's all. Most of what i noticed in the advert personally was the grown men interfering with bullying, which I appreciated that they shed a light on. Or that in cities women notoriously don't find it flattering to be cat called. Not that they're a bad person inherently for doing said things, just that they probably shouldn't do it.",

It's so normalized. How many times have you heard the phrase \"man up\"? Men are pressured to be this unbreakable figure, tough and strong and feeling-less. That's hella fucking toxic, and many men kill themselves because of it. Men are not tought that they can be emotional, fragile. A lot of men with depression don't receive any kind of support. And what do a lot of depressed people do? I dont even need to answer that. One thing is masculinity, being masculine is not bad, but being PRESSURED to do all those things that are supposed to be 'masculine' are toxic. Period. This is not my opinion. It's not a matter of opinion. Its about what's objectively wrong and right. This is reality, and we need to change it.",
