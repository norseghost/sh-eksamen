I am absolutely no one's ideal role model for progressive /reconstructed masculinity, and I'm all for a healthy dollop of cynicism when it comes to absorbing messages about social sensitivity from a fucking corporation in 2019.

Having said that, just spent a few minutes reading a small sample of bitter comments left on the now over half-million downvoted YouTube "Best Men Can Be" video from Gilette, and I have to ask:

Bloody hell mate, what the fuck is fucking wrong with these so-called men?

When confronted with even an overarchingly, painfully unequivocally and even pandering-ly balanced message of 'not all men' video saying "hey let's stop abuse and bullying" and your reflexive response is "it's okay to be white, and straight, and male!" I just... don't understand you boys.

What do you think is at stake here? What is so great about the way things have been, for you, that you're trying to hold in to? What is it you think you're defending? The right to degrade, diminish and hurt other people?

Why are you so afraid? Why are so threatened, so fearful of the other, all the time? When are you going to grow up, man?

I mean my ideas and ideals of being a man, manhood etc might be a little different, open to interpretation, exception, variety and inconsistency might differ from yours and that's cool. It should be.

No one is asking you or me, us to stop being a man, but you are being asked to stop being a dick.
