This is where I’ve become the sublime and ridiculous on the keto diet lacking  in carbs and wearing a weighted vest 
My first couple of exercises I realised I was lacking in carbs not a safe place with only 10 grams eight hours in I was up now was 13.30 A was grateful for the low carb grenade bar 14 grams. Because in the cold weather I can have a weak bladder as I did also what wasn’t helping was the lack of fluids, my last drink was 4 hours before yet I was like Niagara Falls the amount of tines I went for a pee.@ so decide to go without until I returned at 16.00 quite amazing since really did lack the stamina and the risks I took only borderline to crazy. Crazy was the word when I failed miserably at passing myself from one rope to another hoping to do all eight wearing a heavy weight vest. When I tried second time round without vest got myself in even more of a tangle.
