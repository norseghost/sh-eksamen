The Best A Man Can Be.
.
A lot of you will have heard of the advert Gillette has released calling for a change away from ‘toxic’ masculinity. It’s hit a lot of nerves with many praising it and many feeling it’s message is telling men they shouldn’t be masculine and being accused of being bullies and sexual predators.
.
Personally I am all for anything that teaches boys it is not ok to be disrespectful or threatening just because ‘boys will be boys’. Men can be as masculine as they come but there’s no excuse for toxic behaviour. Be the best you can be, regardless of gender.
