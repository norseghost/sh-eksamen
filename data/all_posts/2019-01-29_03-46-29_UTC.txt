This is so important. Something that bothers me is when I see some feminist or male issues account post the phrase: â€œmen can be raped â€˜tooâ€™ â€œ. Why is it so hard to understand that consent is required from everyone and that anyone, male or female, can be perpetrators or survivors. Iâ€™m tired of the media painting men as harassers and women as angels. We need to stop giving issues a gender and raise awareness. - Erik
