        "text": "@andrewpeterson responding from my personal account because I made the original post - yeah, I definitely take any statement made by a corporation (or celebrity...) with a big grain of salt. It can seem a little opportunistic when companies co-opt whatever public conversation is making waves at a given time. But I think this particular message is incredibly important, and the only way to make things better is to get people to talk about it more, even when the conversations are uncomfortable. I think it\u2019s great that Gillette, who markets itself as \u201cthe best a man can get\u201d, is making a statement on what that phrase means in terms of how men and boys treat each other, and how they treat women and girls. And I want to use my own business platform (as small as it is) to keep that conversation going.",
