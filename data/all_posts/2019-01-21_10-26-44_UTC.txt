Hey @gillette my family is OUT! How DARE U attack the wonderful men in my life - my father, grandfather (still w/ us at nearly 92), husband, sons, nephews, & all the women who love/adore/cherish these men are basically being called "stupid" bc God forbid my son have a play wrestling match, or want to ask girl on a date. As a woman, where's video of #toxicfemininity showing just how nasty, vengeful, vindictive, out for blood & to destroy ppl's lives, girls are? Cuz it doesn't fit ur narrative. Did u also know that at a rate of 3X higher, #women MURDER their own children (Filicide), as opposed to men? As a mom of 4 - oldest daughter is 20, oldest son is 16 - whom both endured ACTUAL bullying, like the boy who kicked my daughter to the ground, then kicked her while down. My son was horrifically verbally harassed by a classmate when he was only 11. MOST of the time, it's instigated by females. There's a reason most friends throughout my life have been male, & it's bc females LOVE to f* up the lives of others', even their so-called friends. Bc girls have a higher verbal IQ than boys starting from infancy, as boys are born w/ higher physicality, it reasons that's why females go-to form of aggression is all/mostly verbal crap incl threats of physical violence, and intimidation tactics, as well. God forbid we talk about this, right? Afraid God may lay down his staph & smite u? He's gonna smite u for ur disgusting rhetoric. U'll get urs #Gillette, #karma is a b*tch.
