Originally it was due to the inside of shin guards in \"Futbol\" and then when playing Football, the tape. Though it looked really weird having just my lower legs done, so I went all the way up. Never once did I bitch about it. Personally, I think it's more about women wanting guys to still be into them, without lifting a finger for it, so the things which they have to do to \"Look nice\" are demonized by them.",
