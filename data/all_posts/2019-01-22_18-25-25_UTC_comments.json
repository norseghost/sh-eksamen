It applies to many people both directly and indirectly. I myself do not condone rape or toxic masculinity or the other various topics this ad brought up, but imagine it this way. I'll use myself as an example. My name happens to be Chris Brown, so I've been getting the woman beater jokes going on 10 years now. If they ran a commercial stating that Chris Browns can do better, basing it off of the actions of another Chris, while I would agree that what its telling me not to do is correct, I'm going to be hurt on the inside knowing that the actions of one/few are being used to portray the whole. So yeah, I'm not a Chris Brown who beats women, but if the message is being sent that chris browns need to be better and hold each other to higher standards, how can I not feel that it was targeted at me somehow. That being said I think that we all as HUMANS need to hold each other to higher standards if we expect any kind of cultural change. So while this ad has brought to light some disgusting human behaviors, it simultaneously divided a populous causing a problem on its own. Thank you for hearing me out and have a good day y'all :)",

Just like women know not to throw babies in dumpsters. Its not about identifying with the charactors depicted. People are upset because this ad treats all men like they have no moral compass. This ad is just to make SJWs and Snowflakes not attack their company for all their previous ads of sexualizing women. The company doesn\u2019t really care about what men do. This is just a PR stunt.",

If YOUR masculinity is threatened by an ad which asks men who are not being good people to be better people, you might want to start looking a little harder in the mirror at who you are. Not all men bully, but the ad is spotlighting that some do and it needs to stop. Some boys don\u2019t cyber bully other kids or push them around.... But some do. If there was a commercial about women, and I had not done anything wrong as to identify with the ad, I wouldn\u2019t take offense with it.\n\nWhat have you done?",

Is that qoute I used invalid? The qoute from the commercial that is factually wrong?, 3.btw the first video they showed from the commercial was from the young Turks and clips from speakers of the metoo movement which I don\u2019t disagree with all but it shows their bias and who they side with.\n4.again, Are all men dicks,unkind and unfeeling, the answer is no. So why talk about it and finger wag for the purpose of reinforcing basic life skills again?#\n5. You may see it as innocent and stop there but I read a lot more into this.  Maybe I\u2019m wrong for this and it is possible to see it a that but I feel that would be untrue at this moment and ur aggressive response(cuz it wasn\u2019t a counter argument) that had no points really and just told me to shut up and called me invalid without any evidence as to why is not changing my mind",

They said\u201dsome men are good\u201d no the majority of men are good there is just a minority of men that do these things you talk about and u just painted it to all men.\n2. PC crack down on toxic masculinity- like established above, the PC police in the new wave of feminism have not established a line in what is toxic masculinity and wat is masculinity they kinda just attack all masculinity which this commercial did.\n3.disingenuous\n4.attacked there audience which is bad business.\n5. Pushing agendas- annoying\n6.finger wagging- annoying especially when these are actions I\u2019ve never done.\n7.  Wave of people online telling me something\u2019s wrong with me, I\u2019m smoking something or I see myself in the commercial that\u2019s why I don\u2019t like which is just untrue and ignorant.(to Everyone that disagrees with the commercial)",

The agenda to push out toxic masculinity which WHEN USED is defined vaguely and used as a weapon against men that attacks masculinity as a whole(there is a ripple effect and a movement that you have to acknowledge that has this interest)\n3.  Again blames men for the actions of a minority of men, and the minority of men who are suppose to hear this aren\u2019t going to say \u201cdamn I gotta switch my game up, rape isn\u2019t cool anymore\u201d.lol\n4.  Doesn\u2019t bring to attention good masculinity, or the problems that men have, or even the fact that the majority of men are already against rape, bullying and things of that nature.  Even on social media men make sure disown and condemn any man committing sexual assault.  Alot of men seeing that those who do commit sexual assault should be castrated and so do the men responding to the commercial. \n5.

In conclusion, yeah, if the term were more broad there wouldn't be a problem, and although definitely for marketing and to sell more products, the main intentions were probably not meant to be bad",

After all a good man is a dead man - feminism 2013. My favourite post has to be the mocking of male suicide, where they called men cowards for not bowing down to women and facing there punishment for being men. It was funny, because they said they where sad because there atm where killing themselves. They said the poor ones desevered to die. Because they where no use to women. Got love today society.

Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.\" - MLK Jr. This is true, because the nature of alliances is to prevent the situation where \"First they came for x, but I did nothing. Then they came for y, but I did nothing. Then they came for me, and there was no one left to help me.\" Caring about other people goes a much longer way than being selfish. No matter what, we will be helping you inadvertently because we have a common enemy, the ones who push us to be lesser and push you to be untrue to yourself. It's ok to be vulnerable and empathetic. Also, a similar ad for females wouldn't be telling them to be against femininity, it would be against toxic femininity. The women who abuse their sons, their male partners because they know they can get away with it. No sane, egoistically secure female would ever take offense to such a commercial, since we'd all agree that is a problem and should be dealt with, not relate as being part of the problem being called out and thus feel attacked. There's no \"sides\" or \"gender war,\" we all want the same thing: a better life for everyone. Men shouldn't feel like they have to be a bad guy to be a man, or are bad guys by proxy of the men who give all others a bad name.",
