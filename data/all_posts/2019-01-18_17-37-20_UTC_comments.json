I will also agree with the fact that not all women want or like that. But, let me bring this idea to the table if a woman is walking around professionally dressed ... what would you assume she would want others to think about her when they see her? Now on the other hand, if you see a woman walking down the street in stiletto heels, fishnet stockings or pantyhose, a mini skirt, and a very low cut and revealing shirt ... what would you be drawn to assume that she wants people to think or say to her? I say this because it is a very valid point. Women who dress like mentioned in the second option typically dress that way because they have low self-esteem and are seeking not only validation from others but also attention from either the opposite sex if they are straight or the same sex if they are gay and some from both sexes because they are bi sexual. Some women do this consciously While others do this subconsciously because both emotionally and mentally they are seeking out away to fill a void within their self. Now these same women and we'll use those that do this consciously for this example decide to dress that way to seek attention and when they get it they either act as if they do not enjoy it when they do or they show disgust because the ones that give them that attention do not fit and their own imagined status quo or more plainly put those that give the attention to them or not\ud83d\udd25 hot enough.",

Women do not like being catcalled while they\u2019re walking just as much as they hate it when a creepy guy checks them out and tries to talk to them.
