But There are so many options so that people do not have to be oppressed or remain oppressed. People choose to stay where they are, maybe they are afraid, maybe they are comfortable, maybe they are lazy, or maybe they just dont know their options. But If a Person who really wants to get out of their oppression they absolutely can. Look at Dr. Ben Carson..what an incredible struggle and journey. Actually many of the very wealthy, successful people today all started from nothing.  It's all about attitude in my opinion, and nothing more.",

It was the feminists who almost talked me I to aborting my first baby, so close. They lied to me and said its my right, it's not a human life. I cant thank God enough for the ProLife activits.  Yea I was a teen, yea a minority, yea dirt poor, unmarried, not in any position to raise ababy. But I chose to be responsible for my actions, I chose to respect human life. And instead of blaming abuse, and poverty and men, etc....I understood everything life is what I want it to be. And because I was a woman and very hard off, I had some government assistance to help me through and loans to get through school. So there is no woman out there who can convince me that its mens faults, or that women do not have equal rights. I've proven to women that it all depends on yourself, so stop blaming others.",

Not to mention I'm one of those teen pregnancy statistics, my first child was unplanned, I was young, poor, moved into a 13ft camper with my husband (who was a kid himself at the time). that's where we started.  Nothing was ever given to me, but the lesson of love and respect. And from learning to respect myself, I took care of myself, and from respecting my husband as a man....by not feeling like the world owes me something for being a woman, for being hispanic, for being poor, by not stomping my feet and joining the feminist pity league, I came up from a very low point. Nobody paid for nursing school for me, I had 2 kids as I got through it, we almost lost our home, sold our crib just to get groceries to survive. I mean talk about under priveledged. But if I had a bad attitude and felt it's all because of men, I wouldn't have made it this far. I came this far by loving, respecting and working hard at my life.  All this to say, i may seem like life has been easy, multi business owner, RN, wife, mother...sounds like a great life. and it is.

        "text": "@emako_3lue  that's not what I'm talking about though. I'm talking about the commercial, suggesting that boys will be boys. Meaning it's just natural for a boy to want to be a bully, and to want to assault women. How cruel is that accusation?  And not to mention women are way worse at bullying than men are. It's just very wrong for Gillette to call out man, and claim they are the problem. Women are just as responsible for this problem, the reason women are seen as sex symbols, is because everywhere you look that's all women are doing. Instagram, snapchat, Facebook ,Pornography, stripping, these teenybopper music stars like Ariana Grande portraying herself as a sex idol.... I mean can you blame a man for viewing women that way? We make it look like that's what we want.  But that being said, there are also many men who are not attracted to that stuff whatsoever. My husband and my dad for example, they are disgusted by the way women act and dress, it's a complete turn-off and loss of respect for them. And that's why the commercial ad is very misleading, and a lie. Boys will be boys, also means that they will be respectful, they will protect women, they will love women, and they will spend their lives acting kind towards women....no Gillette ad needed. Feminists make this world such a hateful place, they want war. But women like myself, we dont. We just want to have mutual respect with men, we want to build them up, we know they are capable of great things and we want them to appreciate women, not be forced to.",

        "text": "@therealdokstrange  @emako_3lue  absolutely. And I feel the problem nowadays is women have too many rights and think they are higher and above men, and that we should have all the power to do whatever we want, say what we want, wear what we want, act how we want and men just have to shut up and be muzzled. What happened to the days when women respected men? And the man was the leader? What happened to modest, humble women? If women acted more like ladies, and showed more respect to men...maybe they would act and feel differently towards women. Im a mom of 2 daughters and I hope to raise them with respect for themselves, and for men. It should be equal, not women treading on men every chance they get.",
