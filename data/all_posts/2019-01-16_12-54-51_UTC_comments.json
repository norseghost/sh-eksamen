There are women who are violent towards their partners, there are mothers who abuse their children, there are women involved in human trafficking,modern slavery and child photography! And personally I would love someone to bring it out to the day light and show all those problems to the public. I would not start thinking that I'm bad, offended because I know I'm not one of those women, I know I'm valuable, positive, strong and probably more intelligent than most of those REAL MEN throwing their razors away to manifest their masculinity. We need to step back and look at the problems around us from wider perspective. I work with children and a while ago 6 years old boy told me that all girls should make food when boys are watching football... Such a old fashioned, narrow minded, chauvinistic statement coming from a very young person clearly proof there is lots of issues in our society. So maybe instead of littering our already suffering planet with more plastic you all should start thinking about our future.",

Beauty companies promote make-up that stays on when you exercise because we still need to look attractive and please man's eye even when we sweat our arses off, Gillette ladies razors are all pink or soft blue because those are such a feminine colours, many household adverts still shows women that mop and scrub toilets like it's our role to look after the house and wait for the husband - big and strong man who is out there \"hunting\" to provide. You see, we've been dealing with all those issues for ages but every time when we voice it out, we are told that  we are exaggerating and possibly we are just frustrated lesbians hehe. It happened to you once and you're trying to turn the world upside down because so unfair on you. Political correctness has gone mad! Maybe we should throw everything, grow body hair and go back on trees... And hopefully when we get back down again we will have slightly better understanding of living together in positive balance.",
