Their prime concerns are profit, market share,, improving the position of the stock and their own performance based incentive bonus. That's it. Nothing more. They released this triggering, albeit ham-fisted, ad in an effort regain market share in an industry they're lagging and to put themselves in the limelight for awhile. It was well calculated, well crafted and succeeded in getting alot of people \"lathered up\". We've fallen for it hook, line and sinker.  If you were offended by the ad, great, boycott their stuff. Liked it? Great, do whatever it is you plan to do. But please, for the love of peace, don't believe that Gillette actually gives a hoot about this or any other cause. Donating a million dollars? Pfffft. That's nothing. Also, I believe some of us have  forgotten what a good punch to the jaw feels like",
