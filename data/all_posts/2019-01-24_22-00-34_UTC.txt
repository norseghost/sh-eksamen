@angles90 make it possible to do this impossibly challenging routine. I’d like to see how many of you youngsters who perform some amazing moves will by the time you are towards my age be able to be as fit. Hopefully this can be your awareness lesson. Many things occurred in my life that made my fitness journey far more challenging than I could possibly believed happened. I could ask myself why me? But where would this get me. I believe it is best to accept things as they are, live in the moment and hopefully illness or injury won’t prevent to keeping an eye 👁 on your fitness goals in the years to come whatever your age. #ageisjustanumber #nevergiveup #hiitworkouts #hiit #strongshoulders #thebestamancanbe #anxietyfree
