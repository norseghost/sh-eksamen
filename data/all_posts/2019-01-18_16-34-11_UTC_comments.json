Yea a lot of dudes are shitty, so are women so where is the Gillette toxic femininity ad? Oh wait.... it was a one sided political ad to stir social media mentions. When I was in college I used Gillette razors and sat in my room doing homework. My roommate used betterhomes target brand razors. He drank every night and fucked drunk girls at parties. Maybe there was anti-woman juice in his razors.",
