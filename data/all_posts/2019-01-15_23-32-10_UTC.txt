When #gillette puts out an advert which essentially says "Try not to be a cunt" and your instinctive reaction is "FUCK OFF I'M A REAL MAN YOU SOYBOY LEFTIST FEMINIST COMMIE", you're not actually being masculine or manly, you're just a cunt.
Besides, isn't "being a man" supposed to be about being who you want to be, rather than having to adhere to what some emotionally fragile, chest-beating fannies say it is?
It's no skin off Gillette's balls if you wanna boycott them, because these guys are trying to sell razors for men, not cunts.
