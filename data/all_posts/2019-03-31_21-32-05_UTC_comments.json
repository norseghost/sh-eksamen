This statement isn't addressing whether abortion is ethical or not it's just saying \"even if it isn't it's none of your business\". By that logic you shouldn't speak against school shooters and murders because it's none of your business. Or if someone is about to get shot you shouldn't do anything about it because it's none of your business and it doesn't affect you directly. I'm sorry for people who hold this position because they obviously believe that morality is just a matter of opinion",
