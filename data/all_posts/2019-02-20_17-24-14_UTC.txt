Modern day feminists use the trigger word toxic masculinity to push forth their feminism agenda which we all agree with in many places where women are being oppressed - but the same word; "Toxic masculinity" is also being used to wage war against anything which is masculine in nature such as; being a man, dressing like a man, talking like a man, ensuring the safety and security of one's own family and that is by sleeping with a baseball bat right next to the pillow -misandrists call that "Patriarchy", and working 6-12 hours a day of either hard mental labour or hard physical labour. 
See the less fortunate men carrying loads of weight on their back to feed their woman and child, is that what today is defined as patriarchy and toxic masculinity? I support equal  rights but we shouldn't take for granted the forces of masculinity that brought us privileges which transitioned our state from the dark ages to that of enlightenment. Before the masculine forces brought fourth a means of governance that provided security by the creation of the police and ensured the constant supply of food and provision by the creation of the port system men and women lived in tribes in order to survive. 
In those past days a man let alone a woman couldn't last an entire year without it's tribe which was made up of fellow men. Tribes protected them from other enemy tribes and wild animals. Times where no woman would dare shout "Equal rights" or "What a man can do,  a woman can do better", because they were satisfied with their part picking berries while men's  jobs were risky of that of war and hunting.  Today, the same "Toxic masculinity" created a state, gave women the rights to vote and provided for them an easy life that of salaries and housing filled with air conditioning.  Now that they find life easy brought by millions of men's  deaths striving for the development of civilisation and protection of human rights, toxic feminism has risen to new heights that of misandry and men hating.
