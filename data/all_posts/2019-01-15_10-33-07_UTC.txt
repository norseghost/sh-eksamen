Gillette references toxic masculinity, bullying, and the #MeToo movement in their new advert, and it has split opinion online. The short film titled Believe, encourages men to be "the best a man can be". Also questioning the 'boys will be boys' attitude towards raising boys and girls differently. 
Gillette's president, Gary Coombe has said that 'by holding each other accountable, eliminating excuses for bad behaviour, and supporting a new generation working toward their personal 'best,' we can help create positive change that will matter for years to come'.
What do you think about the divisive advert?
