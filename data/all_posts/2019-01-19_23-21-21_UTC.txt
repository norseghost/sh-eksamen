Here's an unpopular opinion: Any female praising @gillette for being a socially positive company thanks to their ad... you might want to go check your pink tax next time you buy a Razor or any Gillette product. This company doesn't care about you... This ad was an entirely hypocritical PR stunt, filled with beliefs they do not hold. Certainly beliefs their corporate actions show they don't care about. If you can't see past that, then maybe you deserve to pay more for your products. #Gillette #Canadianconservative #ryanwright #alwaysright #boycottgillette #wrestling #wrestler #meme #political #offen
