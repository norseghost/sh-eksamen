How Gillette was framing the situation was that men being despicable and controlled by toxic masculinity is the norm, and telling all men that they need to be better than they are. (I\u2019m not saying there aren\u2019t lots of men out there that need to change though)\nBut if the ad was made framing all women as despicable misandrist femenazis, and saying women being despicable and ignoring the views of men is the norm, and that the majority of women need to change and be better people, there would be a large outcry of sexism.\nAnd personally I feel this is a good framework to bare in mind when crafting something aimed specifically at those of another gender with the intent of correcting or changing the behaviour of that gender \u2014 if it is not a good method of addressing one gender, it will not be a good method of addressing another.",

It\u2019s not a company\u2019s job to do this, it\u2019s their job to make razors. If you want to empower men, thank all the men in the military and law enforcement for risking their lives everyday for you. If you want to empower them, support them whether they act masculine or feminine. If you want to support them, stop assuming that they are inherently sexist/assault people. If you want to empower men, tell them that their feelings are valid. If you want to empower men, don\u2019t belittle them and try to teach them a lesson. Don\u2019t sit men down and teach them not to rape, because inherently they think that you think that they are automatically rapists and bad people. Men deserve positivity, not stigma!",

They need support, not stigma. \ud83d\udc64 The majority of suicide victims are male.\n\ud83d\udc64 There are many more men sleeping rough on the streets than women.\n\ud83d\udc64 The prison population is mostly male.\n\ud83d\udc64 Men are much more likely to have dropped out of school and have no qualifications compared to women.\n\ud83d\udc64 You never hear of an all male shortlist when a company recruits.\n\ud83d\udc64 Females are protected against genital mutilation, nobody cares when boys are circumcised without consent and for absolutely no medical reason.\n\ud83d\udc64 Nearly all domestic violence shelters are for women.\n\ud83d\udc64 If a woman leaves the family home with her child, she is escaping. If a man takes his own child he is kidnapping them.\n\ud83d\udc64 Only women can be raped according to our law.\n\nI could go on for hours. We need equality for all, not feminism and all that rubbish. This has got to stop. #boycottgillette and stand by our men.",
