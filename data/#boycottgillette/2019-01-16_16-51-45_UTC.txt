The outrage over this Gillette commercial is ridiculous.  It's not offensive to be told to take accountability for your actions, it's a clear and obvious media ploy that companies have used to get attention and you were dumb enough to fall for it, and last but not least, throwing away something you already paid for makes you look like a fucking idiot.  Despite the symbolism behind it.  Congrats, you went through all that for something no one is going to care about in a week's time. #boycottgillette #idiots
