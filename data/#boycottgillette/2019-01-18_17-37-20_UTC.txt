the ad clearly disapproves of the bad behaviors it depicts, it simultaneously suggests that most men engage in these behaviors.  It follows that to fit in, or to be “masculine,” one would seek approval by engaging in those behaviors engaged in by a majority of the groups – not the “some men” that is “not enough” in the opinion of Gillette. Ultimately this is a mixed message that one could argue is confusing and makes it unclear to a young male what the message about being masculine and fitting in really is.
