I’m so depressed. I don’t have anything to pretend to be pissed off about. I use a Schick Hydro razor. It’s got 5 blades, WITH a lubricating strip!  AND, the people at Schick don’t care if I objectify women, unlike those spineless bastards at Gillette. Still, sometimes it’s fun to pretend to be mad. *sigh* #schick #schickhydro5 #gillette #boycottgillette #gilletteboycott #fakeanger #caseysthoughts
